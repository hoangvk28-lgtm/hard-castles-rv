  "A 100 amp converter is the top of the usual deck-mount range, and the label alone tells you very little. The same \"100A\" can mean a steady rating or a short peak, it can hold full output only when campground voltage is healthy, and it may or may not charge lithium correctly. On a 12 volt system, 100 amps is roughly 1,200 watts of DC, which is a lot of heat for a small box to shed.",
  "We compared six 100 amp units from $103.90 to $519.99 on what each listing actually publishes: charging profiles for lead-acid and lithium, voltage settings, the low-voltage point where output holds, cooling, protections and cable included. The pool splits into one factory-style replacement for a WFCO 6800 series bay and five lower-cost aftermarket boxes, and the picks below spell out which gaps you accept at each price."

The listing states that it automatically detects lead-acid or LiFePO4 batteries, holds full output down to 100 volts of AC input, and uses power factor corrected charging that it says is up to 30 percent more efficient. It is listed as UL/CSA and FCC compliant.\n\nIt ranks first because it is the only unit here that publishes a low-voltage output claim, a safety listing and automatic battery detection together. The cost is $519.99, which is about $300 more than the PowerMax PM3 and roughly five times the VEVOR. Against those, you are paying for the standards listing and the drop-in fit, not for extra amps, since every unit here shares the same 100A label.\n\nPick this if you are replacing a failed factory converter in a 6800 series bay or want the most documented protection at a campground with weak voltage.

    "explanation": "A converter rated 100 amps should deliver that current steadily, not as a short peak, because 100A at about 13.6 volts is over 1,300 watts of heat-producing work. If a box can only hold that briefly, it will derate or shut down when your fridge, pump and a charging bank all run together. Check the listing for words like \"continuous\" or \"steady output\" and, if absent, ask the seller or read the label photo for the rated amps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low-input-voltage behavior",
    "explanation": "Campground power often sags, and a converter that loses output when AC input drops charges slower exactly when you need it. Only some listings state where full output is held, such as the WFCO claim of full output down to 100 volts. Look for a stated minimum input voltage rather than a generic claim of wide range, and treat silence on the topic as unknown."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lithium charge profile",
    "explanation": "A lithium bank wants a fixed absorb voltage, usually near 14.4 to 14.6 volts, and does not need the equalization or desulfation stage that lead-acid uses. A converter without a true lithium mode may overcharge, undercharge or never finish the cycle. Look for a named LiFePO4 setting, a numbered voltage you can set or fixed steps, then match them to the battery maker's charge spec."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bank size and wire gauge",
    "explanation": "A 100 amp converter can push far more current than a small bank wants, and the DC wire and fuse must be sized for the full 100 amps. A listing that pairs a 100A box with a 75Ah to 80Ah bank is a reminder to check the battery's maximum charge current first. Read the battery's rated charge current and size the cable and fuse to the converter's output, not to the battery alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cooling and noise",
    "explanation": "Heat is the main thing that shortens a converter's life, and a fan solves it at the cost of noise inside a small coach. Some listings describe a temperature-triggered fan and a metal housing, while others only say thermal protection exists. Check whether the listing names a fan, and plan ventilation clearance around the box as the manual specifies."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fit and replacement compatibility",
    "explanation": "Factory bays are shaped for specific series, and a converter that fits the cutout and connectors saves hours of rewiring. The WFCO WF-6800 series is a common standard in RV builds, so a drop-in replacement from the same series is the easiest swap. Compare your existing unit's model label and mounting footprint to the listing's dimensions or fit statement before buying."

    "q": "Will a 100 amp converter fit where my old WFCO sits?",
    "a": "Only the WFCO WF-68100A-AD is stated to belong to the WF-6800 series, so it is the natural drop-in. The other boxes here are aftermarket, deck-mount designs that may need new mounting holes and connector changes. Check the model on your existing unit and measure the opening."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 100 amps too much for my battery bank?",
    "a": "It can be. The VEVOR listing pairs its 100A box with banks rated 75Ah to 80Ah, and many batteries limit charging current to a fraction of capacity. Look up your battery's maximum charge current, and if it is lower than the converter's output, pick a smaller converter or use a current limit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the WFCO worth five times the VEVOR price?",
    "a": "It is worth it if you need the UL/CSA listing, automatic lead-acid and LiFePO4 detection, full output down to 100 volts and a factory-style fit. If you have a known battery, a stable shore supply and can set a voltage by hand, the cheaper units cover the basic job."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set a converter for lithium charging?",
    "a": "Read the battery maker's absorb voltage, then select the matching preset or enter it on an adjustable unit. On the VEVOR and Unbranded 100A, the 14.6V preset is the closest listed to a typical LiFePO4 target, but verify it against your battery's spec. Never leave a 16.5V mode connected to a bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run these without a battery connected?",
    "a": "Some listings describe the box as both a charger and a regulated 12V supply, but a converter with no battery can show unstable voltage under changing loads. Keep a battery in the circuit if the manual does not specifically allow battery-free operation."
  },
  {
    "q": "How often should I check the converter?",
    "a": "Once or twice a season, look for dust in vents, a working fan, tight DC connections and discoloration on terminals. A loose high-current lug heats up quickly at 100 amps. Re-torque to the manual's value if one is given."
