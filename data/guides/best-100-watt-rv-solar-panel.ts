  "A 100 watt panel is a nameplate number, not a daily harvest. That rating is measured in a lab at 1,000 watts per square meter of light and 25°C cell temperature, and a roof in July runs far hotter. Multiply 100W by 3, 5 and 7 peak sun hours and you get 300, 500 and 700 watt-hours as a ceiling. Once wiring, heat and controller losses take roughly a quarter (our estimate, not a listing claim), the usable figures fall to about 225, 375 and 525.",
  "We compared six 100W options priced from $49.99 to $139.95 on cost per watt, physical footprint, what is in the box, and whether the listing lets you work out a real daily number. One of the six is a pair of panels, two are bare panels at very different prices, and three arrive with a controller, so the right pick depends mostly on what you already own."

    "description": "The Renogy 100W is a bare rigid panel built from N-type cells in a 16-busbar layout, with a listed 25 percent conversion efficiency and a temperature coefficient of minus 0.29 percent per degree Celsius. Renogy says it is 11 percent smaller and 8 percent lighter than its earlier 100W model, with an IP65 rating and low-iron tempered glass. At $71.05 it works out to about 71 cents per watt.\n\nIt ranks first because it is the only pick here that publishes a temperature coefficient, the number that decides how much power you lose on a hot roof. At minus 0.29 percent, a cell running 40°C above the lab condition gives up about 11.6 percent (simple arithmetic from the listed figure). It costs $21.06 more than the HQST 100W and $11.06 more than the JJN, in exchange for that disclosure and the newer cell type. It does not include a controller, unlike the Voltset kit that costs $68.90 more.\n\nPick this if you are building a small system around a controller you already have and the roof is hot most of the summer. The caveat is that the listing gives no weight or exact dimensions, so check the product page against your roof space before ordering.",

A square panel of this size is easier to fit beside a vent or a roof fan than a long narrow one.

  {
    "criterion": "Nameplate vs daily watt-hours",
    "explanation": "A 100W rating describes output under laboratory light, not what the roof delivers on a normal day. Multiply watts by the peak sun hours for your location, which is often 3 to 7, then subtract roughly 25 percent for heat, wiring and controller losses to get a usable figure. Treat any listing claiming 500 watt-hours a day from one 100W panel as the best case at 5 sun hours with no losses."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature coefficient",
    "explanation": "This number says how much output drops for each degree Celsius above 25°C, and roof cells commonly run 20 to 40 degrees hotter in summer. A coefficient of minus 0.29 percent per degree costs about 6 to 12 percent in that heat, while a missing value means you cannot compare. Find it in the specs table or bullets, and prefer a panel that publishes it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Roof footprint and weight",
    "explanation": "Panel size decides whether it fits beside vents, AC shrouds and fan covers, and a 100W panel can be anywhere from a compact square to a long rectangle. Weight adds to roof load and affects bracket choice. Look for exact length and width in the listing, then lay out cardboard of the same size on your roof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller amps and voltage",
    "explanation": "A 12V 100W panel makes about 5.5 to 6 amps at maximum power, so a 10A controller has headroom, but adding panels in parallel raises current quickly. The controller must support your battery chemistry, including lithium. Check the amp rating and the battery types listed, and confirm the cold-weather open-circuit voltage is below the controller's input limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "What the box really contains",
    "explanation": "A kit may include a controller, cables and brackets, while a bare panel includes only the glass. Short alligator clip leads suit a portable use but not a permanent roof run, which needs fused cable of the right gauge. Read the package contents line and price the missing parts before deciding."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Expansion ceiling",
    "explanation": "A 100W panel is often the first of several, and a listing may cap the number of panels in series or parallel, as the Rvpozwer notes with three. Exceeding it can overload connectors or the controller. Check the maximum panel count and the controller's input limit before planning a 200W or 300W array."

    "q": "How much power does a 100 watt RV solar panel really make?",
    "a": "At 5 peak sun hours the nominal figure is 500 watt-hours, and about 375 after a typical 25 percent loss estimate. At 3 sun hours that drops to about 225, and at 7 it reaches roughly 525. Shade, panel tilt and heat change it daily."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can one 100W panel run an RV refrigerator?",
    "a": "A small 12V compressor fridge can fit within roughly 375 watt-hours a day, but a 120V residential fridge through an inverter usually cannot. Check the fridge's daily draw and add inverter losses. If the load is close to the limit, step up to the 200W Rvpozwer Pair."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a charge controller with a 100W panel?",
    "a": "Yes for any battery connection. A controller prevents overcharge and matches the voltage to the battery. Bare panels like the Renogy 100W need one added, while the Voltset and Hoysicy kits include one."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the 100W kit worth more than the bare panel?",
    "a": "If you need the controller anyway, a kit often costs about the same as buying separately and saves wiring errors. The Voltset costs $68.90 more than the Renogy panel, which is roughly what a basic controller and brackets cost. Skip it if you own a controller."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a 100W panel to my battery?",
    "a": "Connect the controller to the battery first, then the panel, so the controller detects the system voltage. Use a fuse near the battery, and keep the cable run short. For roof installs, use properly sized cable and a sealed entry."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a 100W panel producing over time?",
    "a": "Wipe the glass when dusty or after bird droppings, since a covered cell can drag down output. Inspect connectors for corrosion twice a year, and check mounting screws after long travel days."
