  "A 1000 watt portable power station is the first size that can run a real appliance in an RV: a coffee maker, a small induction hot plate on low, a 700W microwave on its low setting, or a compressor fridge plus a laptop and router all at once. It is also where marketing gets slippery, because the label means 1000W of continuous AC output, while the 2000W figure on the same box is a surge that lasts a moment. A microwave sold as 1000 watts usually pulls more than that from the wall, so it can still trip the inverter.",
  "We compared five stations priced from $280 to $600 that list 1000W of continuous AC output: four with about 1000Wh of LiFePO4 or similar storage, and one solar bundle. We looked at stored watt-hours, listed weight, number of AC outlets, USB-C wattage, cycle rating, recharge time and cost per watt-hour, and we flag every number a listing leaves out. None of them has a TT-30 outlet, so none can stand in for a 30-amp RV shore connection. If your loads reach past 1000 watts, the 1500 watt guide is the next step."

It adds a 140W USB-C PD port, dual 18W USB-A, a 12V car port and a DC barrel port, and accepts up to 400W of AC input for a full charge in about 3.5 hours, with car and MPPT solar charging as well. A 2W LED with strobe and SOS and a backlit LCD that shows runtime round it out.\n\nAt $299.99 it costs about $0.30 per watt-hour, within a cent of the STARYLINE and EBL, and it is $20.02 more than the GRECELL 999Wh. What separates it is the 140W USB-C and the third AC outlet, since the STARYLINE and both 999Wh units give you two.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "The 1000W figure is the continuous AC output, while the 2000W peak is a momentary surge. A device that draws 1000W running can still trip the inverter if its startup draw rises. Look for the words continuous or rated next to the number, and add the running wattage of everything on at once."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stored energy and real runtime",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours decide how long you run a load, and about 85 percent of the number is usable after inverter losses, as the GRECELL listing's own formula uses. A 999Wh unit at a 100W load runs roughly 8.5 hours. Check the Wh in the title or bullets, not mAh, and be wary of the bundle that omits it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Microwave and appliance reality",
    "explanation": "A microwave marked 1000W usually draws about 1,400 to 1,500W from the wall, so it can overload a 1000W inverter even though the label matches. Induction plates, coffee makers and hair dryers behave similarly. Check the appliance's input wattage on its rating plate, not the cooking power on the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and handle",
    "explanation": "The listed weights run 17 pounds up to 27.73 pounds, and two listings publish none. At the heavy end, steps or a high cabinet become a two-hand job. Verify weight and handle design before buying, and ask the seller when it is missing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC outlets and USB-C wattage",
    "explanation": "Three outlets with a 140W USB-C, as on the CYBPULTE, lets a fridge, laptop and CPAP share the station without a strip. Two outlets with 60W USB-C, as on the GRECELL and EBL, is enough for simpler setups. Read the port list in the listing, since the headline shows only 1000W."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cycle rating and recharge",
    "explanation": "Cycle ratings here run from 2,000 plus to over 3,000, and a CYBPULTE-style 400W AC input recharges in about 3.5 hours. Daily cycling needs the higher rating, while storm backup does not. Look for the cycle number, the capacity retained at that number and the AC input wattage."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What can a 1000 watt portable power station run in an RV?",
    "a": "A compressor fridge, laptops, a router, a CPAP, lights, a small fan and a coffee maker or kettle on low draw fit within 1000W. A roof air conditioner, electric heater or full-power microwave will not. Add running wattages and keep the total under 1000W continuous."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can it power an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Generally no. A typical RV roof air conditioner draws well over 1000 watts running and more at startup, so you need a larger station with an inverter well above this class. The 1500 and 2000 watt guides cover that next tier."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the CYBPULTE worth $20 more than the GRECELL 999Wh?",
    "a": "If you need a third AC outlet or a 140W USB-C, yes. If you only need one or two plugs, the GRECELL gives 999Wh and 17 pounds for $279.97. The CYBPULTE listing does not state a weight."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I recharge from solar?",
    "a": "Connect a panel within the unit's solar limit, such as the STARYLINE's 300W maximum. The STARYLINE listing quotes 6 to 8 hours with a 200W panel in strong sun. Match the panel's voltage and wattage to the input range before buying."
  },
  {
    "q": "What wattage microwave can I run?",
    "a": "A 700W cooking microwave typically draws about 1,000W from the wall, so it sits right at the limit. Use a lower setting or a smaller microwave, and check the label input rating. Overloading shuts the inverter off."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store it between trips?",
    "a": "Turn off AC and any wireless pad, keep it dry, and top up every 3 to 6 months as the CYBPULTE listing recommends. A closed vehicle in summer or freezing weather is hard on the battery."
