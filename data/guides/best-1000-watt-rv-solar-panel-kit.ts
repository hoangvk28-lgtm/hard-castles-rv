  "A 1000 watt solar array is the point where an RV stops topping up a battery and starts running real loads. On paper it harvests about 4 kilowatt-hours on a four-hour sun day, and with typical system losses of roughly 25 percent (our estimate, not a listing claim) a realistic figure is closer to 3 kWh. The part most shoppers miss is the charge controller: a 1000W array on a 12V battery can push roughly 70 to 83 amps, and a 40A controller will quietly cap the output near 576W.",
  "We compared six kits and panel packs priced from $269.99 to $579.99 on how they reach 1000W (two huge panels, five mid-size ones or ten small ones), whether a controller is included and how big it is, what the listing says about weight and roof footprint, and cost per watt. The spread is more than 2 to 1, and the picks below explain what the extra money buys."

    "description": "This kit pairs two 500W flexible monocrystalline panels with a 40A charge controller for $369.99, or about $0.37 per watt. The listing says the panels suit 12 to 48V battery charging, bend to fit curved roofs, and have six grommet holes so they can be fastened with screws or attached with silicone and adhesive tape. The junction box is described as sealed and waterproof.\n\nIt ranks first because it is the only pick that includes a controller with a stated amp rating at a price near the cheapest options. Against the Portable 500W Kit it costs $99 more and its controller is smaller, 40A versus 50A, so it is the weaker kit on charging headroom. Against the 5x200W N-Type pack it saves $210, but it gives up rigid glass panels and the long performance warranty that pack lists.\n\nPick it if you want one box that covers panels and a controller and you are comfortable bonding flexible panels to a roof. The caveat is the controller: at a 14.4V charging voltage, 40A is about 576W, so on a 12V battery this kit cannot use its full 1000W unless you wire for 24V or higher.",

The listing says the panels bend up to 30 degrees to follow curved roofs without complex brackets.\n\nIt ranks second because it undercuts the Flex 500W Kit by $99 and offers a 50A controller instead of 40A, which lets a 12V array reach about 720W at 14.4V (an estimate) instead of 576W. It matches the Flex Basic Kit on price but states its controller size and efficiency, which that listing does not.

It is described as a 1000 watt flexible kit with a charge controller, using monocrystalline cells, a sealed waterproof junction box and six mounting holes for fasteners, silicone or tape. The listing positions it for RVs, boats, campervans and golf carts.\n\nIt ranks third because the listing never states the controller amp rating, the panel count or the individual panel wattage, while the Portable 500W Kit costs just $1 more and publishes a 50A controller and 23 percent efficiency. Compared with the Flex 500W Kit you save $100, but you are taking the missing numbers on trust.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Controller amps versus array watts",
    "explanation": "A charge controller limits how many amps flow into the battery, so its rating caps how much of a big array you can use. On a 12V battery charging at about 14.4V, a 40A controller handles roughly 576W and a 50A one roughly 720W (our estimate). Look for the controller amp rating in the title or bullets, and if it is missing, ask the seller before you pay."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "How the 1000W is made up",
    "explanation": "Listings reach 1000W with two 500W panels, five 200W panels or ten 100W panels, and each layout changes weight, wiring and shading behavior. Two huge panels are hard to fit and a single shaded corner can hurt more of the array, while ten small panels need more connectors. Count the panels in the title and check whether sizes are given."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Roof area and weight",
    "explanation": "At about 23 percent efficiency, 1000W needs roughly 45 to 55 square feet of unshaded roof, and rigid glass adds weight, such as 23.8 pounds per 200W panel. An RV roof also has vents, an air conditioner and antennas that cut your usable area. Measure the free space on your roof and compare it with the listed panel dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flexible versus glass surface",
    "explanation": "Flexible ETFE panels weigh less and bend, but when bonded flat they have no airflow behind them, and one listing here warns not to mount on wood, asphalt shingles, fabric or foam. Glass panels with an aluminum frame sit on brackets and carry named standards. Read the mounting instructions in the listing and choose based on your roof surface."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Series versus parallel wiring",
    "explanation": "Wiring panels in series raises voltage and lowers current, which lets a smaller controller handle more watts, while parallel raises current and needs thicker cable. A 1000W array at 12V can reach 78A, but at 48V the same array is about 21A. Check the panel voltage and the controller's maximum input voltage before you pick a wiring plan."

    "criterion": "Real daily energy",
    "explanation": "A 1000W array produces about 4 kWh on a four-hour sun day on paper, but heat, dirt, wiring loss and shading usually cut that to about 3 kWh (our estimate). Compare that figure with your daily use, which for a fridge, lights and a laptop may be only 1 to 2 kWh. Do the sum for your own appliances rather than trusting a listing's daily output claim."

    "q": "Can a 1000W solar kit run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Only for short periods. A 13,500 BTU rooftop air conditioner draws roughly 1,200 to 1,800 watts while running, more than a 1000W array can supply, and it needs a large inverter and battery bank. Solar can offset part of the load, but plan on shore power or a generator for steady air conditioning."
  },
  {
    "q": "What size charge controller does a 1000W array need?",
    "a": "For a 12V battery you need about 80A (1000W divided by 12.8V is roughly 78A). For a 24V bank about 40A, and for 48V about 21A. A 40A or 50A controller will work with a 12V bank but will clip the output, so budget for a bigger one or wire at a higher voltage."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Portable 500W Kit better than the Flex 500W Kit?",
    "a": "On charging headroom yes: it lists a 50A controller versus 40A and costs $99 less. The Flex 500W Kit offers 12 to 48V compatibility and a sealed junction box in its listing. If you are on a 12V system, the 50A controller is the more useful difference."

    "q": "How do I mount flexible panels on a fiberglass roof?",
    "a": "Clean and dry the surface, test the adhesive on a small spot, and use the panel's grommet holes or adhesive made for the roof material. Leave airflow where you can, since heat trapped under a flat-bonded panel lowers output. Follow the maker's heat and combustible-material warnings."
  },
  {
    "q": "How many batteries do I need with 1000W of solar?",
    "a": "A rule of thumb is to store at least a day of your usage. If you use 2 kWh daily, a 200Ah 12V lithium battery stores about 2.56 kWh, and a 1000W array can refill it in a sunny day. Lead-acid banks need to be about twice as large for the same usable energy."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a 1000W system safe?",
    "a": "Fuse each parallel string, size cables for the amperage, use a combiner box for ten-panel setups, and check connectors yearly. Clean panels with water and a soft cloth, and inspect roof seals around every bracket."
