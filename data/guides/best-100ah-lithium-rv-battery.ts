  "A 12.8V 100Ah lithium battery stores 1,280 watt-hours on the label, and that single number is where most 100Ah comparisons stop. For an RV the more useful questions are physical and electrical: will it drop into a Group 24 or Group 31 tray, how much current can the battery protection circuit pass, at what temperature does it refuse to charge, and can you read its charge level without a separate monitor. Those answers differ more than the capacity does.",
  "We compared six 12V 100Ah LiFePO4 batteries priced from $142.99 to $219.99 on cost per nominal kilowatt-hour, case size class, published temperature limits, monitoring and warranty. The whole field costs between about $112 and $172 per kWh, so a spread of $77 between cheapest and dearest comes down to size, app and documentation rather than energy. One 100Ah battery is also the natural building block for larger banks, so we noted how each one expands."

    "criterion": "Nominal versus usable energy",
    "explanation": "A 12.8V 100Ah battery stores 1,280 watt-hours nominally, which is the number every listing prints. What you can use depends on the cutoff voltage, the discharge rate and inverter losses, so a 1,000W microwave pulling from it will not deliver the full 1,280Wh. Divide price by 1.28 to compare cost per kilowatt-hour, and read whether the cycle claim is at 100, 80 or 60 percent depth of discharge."

    "criterion": "Group 24, Group 31 and Group 22NF fit",

A Group 31 is about 13 by 6.8 by 8.4 inches, while a mini Group 24 is about 10.2 by 6.6 by 8.2 inches, and the wrong size leaves a loose battery that needs a new tray. Measure the tray in length, width and height, then compare against the dimensions printed on the product page, not the group name."

    "criterion": "BMS continuous and surge amps",
    "explanation": "The battery management system limits the current the battery can deliver. A 100A BMS at 12.8V supports about 1,280 watts, which is plenty for lights, pump and fridge but too little for a 2,000W inverter at full load. Look for the continuous amp rating in the bullet points, and note that the surge number, such as 330A for CYCLENBATT, only lasts a moment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Exact cold-weather cutoffs",

    "criterion": "Monitoring you can actually read",
    "explanation": "A 100Ah battery has no fuel gauge unless the maker adds one. Bluetooth apps show voltage, current and temperature, an LED meter shows rough charge, and the least expensive option is a standalone shunt. Check that the app exists for your phone type and note that Bluetooth range is short, so it cannot replace a monitor mounted in the cabin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Series and parallel limits",
    "explanation": "A single 100Ah battery is often the first of several, so the expansion limit matters on day one. Most listings here allow 4S4P for 20.48kWh, and expanding with a different model or age can unbalance the bank. Buy identical units, and confirm the warranty still applies to a multi-battery bank."

  {
    "q": "Is a 100Ah lithium battery enough for an RV?",
    "a": "For a weekend with lights, a water pump, a fan and a phone charger, yes. A 1,280Wh battery at an average 60W load runs roughly 21 hours before inverter losses. Add a microwave, TV or air conditioner and you will want 200Ah or more, so see our 200Ah guide."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will my converter charge a 100Ah lithium battery correctly?",
    "a": "Many older converters use a lead-acid profile that can undercharge lithium. Look for a lithium mode, or a charger that outputs about 14.6 volts. Our converter guides list lithium-ready models."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Group 31 or the Group 24 battery better?",
    "a": "Group 24 is smaller and fits tight trays, while Group 31 has more room and is the common standard in travel trailers. Neither is more powerful at 100Ah, so choose by what fits your tray."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect two 100Ah batteries for 200Ah?",
    "a": "Wire them in parallel: positive to positive and negative to negative, using equal-length cables so the load shares evenly. Use two matching batteries, charge them together, and keep a fuse on the main positive lead."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a battery monitor on a 100Ah battery?",
    "a": "Not if it has Bluetooth, but a shunt gives a more accurate state of charge, and it works across the whole bank if you add more batteries later. Without any monitor you can only watch voltage, which stays flat across most of the lithium discharge curve."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I leave a lithium battery connected over winter?",
    "a": "Disconnect it from loads and store it around 50 to 80 percent charge, in a space that stays above the charge cutoff temperature if possible. Check the voltage every month or two, since the monitor and BMS draw a small standby current."
