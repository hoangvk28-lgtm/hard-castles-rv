  "A 100Ah label sounds like one fixed amount of power, but it is only a capacity tier, and the chemistry inside decides how much of it you can actually draw. A 12.8V lithium iron phosphate battery holds about 1,280 watt-hours and can be run down most of the way. A 12V AGM battery holds about 1,200 watt-hours on paper, yet lead-acid wears out fast when drained below half, so a sensible plan treats it as roughly 600 usable watt-hours.",
  "We compared six 100Ah batteries, four lithium and two AGM, priced from $142.99 to $319.59. Instead of ranking them only by sticker price, we compared them by estimated cost per usable kilowatt-hour, the exact temperatures where charging stops, the case size class and how each listing handles the question of starting an engine, which none of these are built for."

It has a 100A battery management system, grade A cells, an ABS case described as dustproof and weather-resistant, and Bluetooth 5.0 with an app for iOS and Android, a feature that most batteries at this price skip. It can be wired in series or parallel for larger banks.\n\nIt takes the top spot because it is the cheapest battery here at $142.99 and still includes an app, so it beats the yeagulch Group 31 by $2.30 while adding monitoring. Against the Super Empower Group 24 it costs $37 less but gives up a stated cold-weather charging rule. Against the two AGM batteries it costs about the same to buy and, at an estimated 80 percent usable lithium capacity, works out near $140 per usable kilowatt-hour versus roughly $283 to $292 for AGM at 50 percent.\n\nPick this if you want lithium for the least money and like seeing charge level on your phone. The caveat is that the listing gives no exact low-temperature cutoff, so if the battery rides in an unheated bay, confirm the freezing behavior with the seller first.",

How much you can draw matters more, since lithium is routinely drained 80 percent or more while AGM lasts far longer if kept near 50 percent. Divide each price by your realistic usable kilowatt-hours, not the nameplate, and check the listing for a depth-of-discharge figure beside any cycle-life claim."

Look for the exact temperature in the listing, as the Super Empower listing gives, and for the restart temperature, since 41°F is not the same as 32°F."

    "criterion": "Charger compatibility",
    "explanation": "Older RV converters hold a lead-acid profile that tops out near 13.6V and can leave lithium under-charged, while a lithium battery on a flooded profile may charge slowly. AGM wants a charge near 14.4 to 14.7V. Check your converter's label for a lithium or AGM mode before buying, and compare it with the battery's stated charge voltage range."

  {
    "criterion": "Starting versus house use",
    "explanation": "A deep-cycle 100Ah battery is built to supply modest current for hours, not the hundreds of amps an engine starter pulls. The yeagulch listing, for example, warns against use as a starting battery. Treat these as house batteries and keep a separate cranking battery for the tow vehicle or motorhome engine, and check the listing for a CCA figure only if the seller claims dual-purpose use."

  {
    "q": "Is a 100Ah battery enough for an RV?",
    "a": "For a weekend with lights, a water pump and phone charging, one 100Ah lithium battery usually works, as 1,280Wh at 80 percent usable covers about 1,000Wh a day. A fridge on a compressor or an inverter-driven microwave will use more, so many owners run two batteries."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I replace a 100Ah AGM with lithium without changing the wiring?",
    "a": "Often yes if the Group size matches, but you must check the charger. A lead-acid converter may undercharge lithium, so look for a converter with a lithium mode or use a DC-DC charger. Also confirm the cable gauge handles the BMS current."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Litime Xtra Mini worth the extra cost?",
    "a": "Only if space is the constraint. It stores the same 1,280Wh as the $142.99 Buknuwo, and its edge is a case about 29 percent smaller than a Group 24. In a roomy tray, that money is better spent on a second battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect two 100Ah batteries?",
    "a": "For 12V, wire positive to positive and negative to negative in parallel, and use identical batteries with equal-length cables so the load shares evenly. Wiring in series gives 24V and is only right if your system is 24V. Stay within the maker's limit of four units."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can AGM and lithium batteries be mixed in one bank?",
    "a": "No. They need different charge voltages and have different internal resistances, so one chemistry will be overcharged or undercharged. Keep one chemistry per bank and replace all batteries at once."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a 100Ah battery over winter?",
    "a": "Store lithium at around half to 80 percent charge, disconnected, in a space above its low-temperature charging limit when possible. Store AGM fully charged, because the Weize listing recommends keeping it charged, and top it up every few months."
