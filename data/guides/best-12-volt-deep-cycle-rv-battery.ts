  "A deep cycle battery is bought for how many times it can be drained and refilled, not for how much it holds on day one. That is why the number on the box that matters is cycles at a stated depth of discharge. One LiFePO4 listing here claims 4,500 cycles when drained completely and 8,000 when drained to 80 percent; a typical lead-acid battery, by the same listing's own comparison, manages 300 to 500. Run the arithmetic and the cheaper battery is often the expensive one.",
  "We compared five 12V deep cycle batteries priced from $164.49 to $349.99: three two-packs of 100Ah LiFePO4, one single 100Ah LiFePO4 and one 100Ah AGM as the lead-acid reference. Each is judged on the cycles it claims at each depth, the cost per kilowatt-hour delivered over that life, case size, cold behavior and the 12V wiring rules that decide whether two batteries add capacity or accidentally make 24V."

The listing gives the cycle curve in three steps: 4,000 cycles at 100 percent depth of discharge, 6,000 at 80 percent and 15,000 at 60 percent. It also claims about 95 percent usable capacity even at a 100A draw, thanks to a flat discharge curve, against about 50 percent for lead-acid.\n\nAt $286.59 for the pair, each battery costs about $143.30, which is $11.70 less than the HeyFuture, $31.70 less than the SUPER EMPOWER and $66.69 less than the MARSENERGY. On the listing's 80 percent claim, 6,000 cycles of roughly 1,024Wh each is about 6,144 kilowatt-hours delivered, or around 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, an estimate based on the stated cycle count. It lists no warranty length and no cold-charging threshold.\n\nPick this when you want two batteries for a 200Ah bank at the lowest cost per cycle in this guide.

What you gain is a better cycle claim at full depth, 4,500 versus 4,000.\n\nPick it if you drain the battery completely most days and want the strongest written claim at 100 percent depth.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cycles at a stated depth",
    "explanation": "A cycle is one full discharge and recharge, and the count shrinks the deeper you drain. The yeagulch listing claims 4,000 cycles at 100 percent, 6,000 at 80 percent and 15,000 at 60 percent, so a battery used to 60 percent may last nearly four times as long. Find the line that pairs cycles with a percentage, and if there is only a bare number, assume it is the shallow figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cost per delivered kilowatt-hour",
    "explanation": "Price alone misleads, because a cheaper battery that dies sooner costs more per unit of energy. Divide price by the cycles claimed times usable watt-hours: about 2.3 cents for the yeagulch against roughly 68 cents for the AGM, using the seller's numbers and a 400-cycle midpoint for lead-acid. Run this sum on any battery you consider and treat claims as the seller's, not independent results."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "12V pack wiring",
    "explanation": "Two 12V batteries in parallel stay at 12V and double the amp-hours, while two in series make 24V, which would damage 12V loads. Parallel strings also need matching batteries of the same age and a balanced start. Charge each separately before joining them, and use equal-length cables."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage under load",
    "explanation": "Lithium holds near 12.8V most of the way down, so an inverter keeps running, whereas an AGM sags as it discharges and may trip the inverter's low-voltage alarm early. That is why a nominal 100Ah AGM often feels like less. Look for a flat discharge curve claim, as the yeagulch lists, and check your inverter's low-voltage cutoff."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature limits",
    "explanation": "Lithium cells should not be charged below freezing, so batteries pause near 32°F, as the SUPER EMPOWER states, while AGM keeps charging. Cold also trims capacity from both. Find the stated charge and discharge ranges and plan around your winter bay temperature."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Case size and warranty",
    "explanation": "Group 24 and Group 31 are different lengths, and the yeagulch is Group 31 while the HeyFuture, SUPER EMPOWER and MARSENERGY are Group 24. A warranty should be at least as long as you expect the cycles to last, five years here for the SUPER EMPOWER and MARSENERGY. Measure your tray and read the warranty line."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between deep cycle and starting batteries?",
    "a": "A starting battery delivers a short burst of high current and is damaged by deep discharge, while a deep cycle battery delivers steady current and is built for repeated draining. House loads in an RV should run on deep cycle batteries."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I wire two 12V 100Ah batteries in series?",
    "a": "Series connection makes 24V, which is wrong for a 12V RV system. For 12V and 200Ah, connect them in parallel, positive to positive and negative to negative, using the same brand and age of batteries."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a lithium two-pack worth it over a single AGM?",
    "a": "For daily use, yes. The yeagulch pair costs $122.10 more than the Renogy AGM but stores 2,560Wh nominal against about 1,200, and its claimed cycle life gives a far lower cost per kilowatt-hour."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect two batteries in parallel?",
    "a": "Fully charge both separately, then link the positive terminals and the negative terminals with equal-length cables. Take the main connections from opposite corners of the pair so they share load evenly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does depth of discharge really change battery life?",
    "a": "Yes. The listings here show 4,000 or 4,500 cycles at 100 percent but 15,000 at 60 percent for the same battery. Using a larger bank so each cycle is shallower is the cheapest way to extend life."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store deep cycle batteries over winter?",
    "a": "Charge AGM fully and disconnect loads. Leave lithium at a partial charge, disconnected, in a space above its low-temperature limit if possible, and check voltage every two months."
