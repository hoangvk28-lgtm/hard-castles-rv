  "Not every RV owner needs a shunt and a color screen. If you just want to know whether the 12 volt battery under the step is healthy, or whether the house bank is sagging, a voltage-based monitor that clips on or panel-mounts for $10 to $50 answers the question. The catch is understanding what voltage can and cannot tell you, because a reading of 12.8 volts means different things on a lead acid battery and a lithium one.",
  "We compared six voltage-based 12 volt monitors from $9.99 to $47.99: three Bluetooth battery testers that stay clamped on the terminals and three panel or plug-in meters. Most are sold for cars, so we read each listing for what applies to RV batteries and what does not, and where a unit adds temperature or history. Full shunt-based monitors, which count amp-hours, are covered in our sibling guides. Treat these as health and voltage gauges, not fuel gauges."

It draws about 1 milliamp and has an IP67 housing with reverse-polarity and short-circuit protection.\n\nIt ranks first at $47.99 because it is the most documented: a stated idle draw, a stored history, a temperature reading and clear limits. It costs $8.00 more than the BM7, which lists similar functions with less precision on what it does not do, and $22.51 more than the BM200.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Why voltage is a poor fuel gauge",
    "explanation": "Battery voltage falls under load and recovers at rest, and a rested lead acid battery moves only about a volt between full and empty. A lithium iron phosphate battery sits near 13 volts across most of its charge and only drops sharply at the end. Treat voltage readings as a health check and use a shunt monitor when you need a real percentage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry setting",
    "explanation": "A monitor that assumes a lead acid voltage curve will show a lithium battery as nearly empty or nearly full at the wrong times. Some units let you program the voltage that corresponds to each percent. Check the listing for lithium support and a programmable table, not just a compatible battery type list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Idle current draw",
    "explanation": "A monitor that draws 1 milliamp uses roughly 24 milliamp-hours a day, a tiny amount, while 15 milliamps uses about 360 milliamp-hours a day, which matters over a winter in storage. A rig parked for four months would lose about 43 amp-hours at that rate. Read the listing for an idle or standby figure and wire panel meters through a switch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bluetooth range and history",
    "explanation": "Bluetooth only reaches your phone within roughly 10 to 30 feet, so a log stored on the monitor and synced later is what actually gives you a record of the weeks you were away. The BM300 Pro and BM7 list 72 days of storage. Check for stored history rather than only live readings."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature reading source",
    "explanation": "A temperature figure is only useful if it measures the battery. The DROK reads its own internal temperature, not the battery's or the air around it, and the clamp-on units read at the terminal. Check what the listing says the sensor is measuring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Car features versus RV needs",
    "explanation": "Cranking and charging tests apply to a starter battery during engine starts, which suits a motorhome's chassis battery but not a house bank that is never cranked. A monitor sold for cars may still report voltage fine. Check which features apply to the battery you are actually watching."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a voltage monitor tell me how much battery is left?",
    "a": "Only roughly. On lead acid a rested voltage maps loosely to charge, but under load or on lithium it misleads. For a real percentage you need a shunt-based monitor, which counts amp-hours."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will these monitors work on a 12 volt lithium RV battery?",
    "a": "They show voltage correctly, but percent figures built for lead acid will be wrong. The DROK lets you program the percentage per voltage, and the ANCEL units list lithium support, but treat percentages as estimates."

    "q": "Is the ANCEL BM300 Pro worth $22.51 more than the BM200?",
    "a": "If you want a temperature reading, a 72-day history and a lower 1 milliamp draw, yes. If you only need a cranking and voltage check on a chassis battery, the BM200 at $25.48 is enough."

  {
    "q": "How do I install a clip-on Bluetooth battery monitor?",
    "a": "Attach the red lead to the positive terminal and the black lead to the negative, secure both leads, pair the phone through the app and set the battery type. Mount it away from thick metal for the best signal."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these monitors drain my battery in storage?",
    "a": "The Bluetooth clamps list about 1 milliamp, which is small, while the Linkstyle lists up to 15 milliamps while not charging. For a long storage period, disconnect a panel meter or wire it through a switch."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use one monitor on multiple batteries?",
