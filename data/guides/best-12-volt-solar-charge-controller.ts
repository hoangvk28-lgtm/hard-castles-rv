export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Amps for a 12V bank",
    "explanation": "The minimum controller amps for a 12V bank is panel watts divided by 12, so 300W is about 25A and 400W is about 33A. The same wattage needs half the amps on a 24V bank, which is why 12V controllers get large quickly. Add roughly 20 percent headroom and compare to the listed amp rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel voltage on a 12V battery",
    "explanation": "On a 12V system, a PWM controller drags the panel down to the battery's level, wasting the difference between a panel's roughly 18V working voltage and the battery. MPPT recovers much of that waste. A single 12V-class panel loses less than a long string."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lithium compatibility at 12V",
    "explanation": "A 12V LiFePO4 battery wants an absorption voltage near 14.2 to 14.6V and no equalization. Lead-acid-only units like the Rolokit models cannot be relied on for that. Look for a named lithium mode or user-set voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "12V-only versus auto-detect",
    "explanation": "Some units are fixed 12V, while others auto-detect 12V or 24V. Auto-detect adds a failure mode if the battery is deeply discharged and reads low. Pick fixed 12V if you will never change, and auto-detect only if you might."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel Voc on a 12V bank",
    "explanation": "Open-circuit panel voltage rises in cold weather, so keep the series total below the controller's maximum PV input. Bateria Power 20A lists a 60V limit, which is fine for parallel panels but tight for a series pair of large panels. Check your panel labels."
