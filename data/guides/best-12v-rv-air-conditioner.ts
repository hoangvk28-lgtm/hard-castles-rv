  "A 12V RV air conditioner only makes sense if your battery bank can feed it, so the useful question is how many hours each unit claims per amp-hour of storage. Rooftop 12V units like the iRooVee and Outequip quote runtimes against 300Ah to 480Ah banks, while a mini split like the Josbuynls trades capacity for a tiny draw.",
  "This guide ranks six units strictly on that off-grid angle and leaves the broad 120V rooftop comparison to the parent air conditioner guide. One pick, the Tusoma, still needs 115V alongside 12V, and its entry states that plainly rather than treating it as battery-only."

  {
    "criterion": "True 12V versus dual power",
    "explanation": "Some units labeled for RVs still need 115V AC and 12V DC together, which defeats off-grid use. This matters because you may buy a unit you cannot power. Read the power note on the listing before you order."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rooftop versus split",
    "explanation": "A rooftop unit needs a roof opening, often 14 by 14 inches, while a split needs two parts and line routing. The wrong style means cutting or rewiring. Check your roof and compare against the stated opening size."

  {
    "criterion": "Cooling capacity honesty",

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Heating option",
