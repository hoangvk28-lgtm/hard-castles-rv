  "A 1500 watt portable power station is the size where a camper can run a kettle, a toaster or a compressor fridge with a laptop and CPAP beside it, all from a box you can still lift by yourself. It is also the size where the battery behind the inverter varies the most: two stations here share the same 1500W rating, yet one stores 1,024Wh and another 2,010Wh, which is nearly twice the runtime for about $130 more. The rated 1500W is continuous AC output. The 3,000W number beside it is a surge that lasts a moment.",
  "We compared five stations from $499 to $999 that list 1500W as rated AC output: two Jackery 1000 v2 variants with different capacity and warranty claims, an Anker SOLIX S2000, and two Jackery solar bundles. We looked at stored watt-hours, weight, UPS switchover, cycle rating, solar input, outlet count and cost per watt-hour, and we say plainly where a listing does not publish a number. None has a TT-30 outlet, so none can replace a 30-amp RV shore connection. If you need that, the 3000 watt guide covers stations that do."

  {

    "explanation": "The 1500W rating is what the inverter can hold, while the 3,000W peak lasts a moment for a motor start. A 1,500W kettle plus a toaster will trip it even though each alone fits. Look for the word rated or continuous and add the appliances you run together."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stored watt-hours",
    "explanation": "At 1500W the battery is the limiting factor, so 1,070Wh and 2,010Wh give very different days. A 100W fridge, lights and laptop load runs roughly 9 hours on 1,070Wh as an estimate. Compare the Wh in the title and divide price by it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and steps",
    "explanation": "The listed weights run 23.4 to 35.7 pounds, and the heavier one is a genuine two-hand carry. A foldable handle helps but does not reduce mass. Check the listed weight and decide where the station will live."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "UPS and surge protection",
    "explanation": "A UPS switchover under 10ms keeps a PC and router up through a power flicker, while a surge shield helps when you plug into a campground pedestal. Only some listings state these numbers. Look for the milliseconds and the surge voltage in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cycle rating and chemistry",
    "explanation": "Ratings here run from 4,000 cycles to 70 percent up to 10,000 cycles, and all use LFP. A weekly user will never wear out any of them, but a daily cycler will. Look for the cycle count and the capacity retained at that number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input and bundles",
    "explanation": "Solar input limits run to 400W, and a single 200W panel refills 1,070Wh slowly. Bundles hide a panel price of roughly $200 to $300 each. Check the maximum solar input and what is actually in the box."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What can a 1500 watt portable power station run in an RV?",
    "a": "A kettle, toaster, coffee maker, fridge, laptop, router and CPAP fit if you keep the combined running load under 1500W. A roof air conditioner, electric heater or full-power microwave with other loads will exceed it. Add appliance wattages and stay under the rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can it run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Often no. A typical roof air conditioner draws more than 1500W at startup and needs a larger inverter. Check the label for running and starting amps before relying on a 1500W station."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the HomePower 1000 v2 worth $50 over the Explorer 1000 v2?",
    "a": "If you need a stated 10ms UPS, surge protection or the 6,000-cycle rating, yes. For runtime it is 46Wh smaller, so no. Choose by feature, not capacity."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I get the one-hour charge on the Jackery?",
    "a": "Turn on emergency charging in the Jackery app before each charge. The default is a 1.7-hour mode on the Explorer 1000 v2 and a 1.25-hour mode on the HomePower. The faster mode is for emergencies."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I buy the solar bundle or panels separately?",
    "a": "The bundles price a 200W panel at about $200 and the second at about $300. Compare with the panel prices you can find separately and the maximum solar input of the station before deciding."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use it while it is charging?",
    "a": "The Anker and Jackery listings describe UPS switchover and charging modes, which allow use while plugged in. Heavy loads while charging generate heat, so leave room for airflow."
