  "A 2000 watt label can mean 2000 running watts or 2000 surge watts that last seconds, and that gap decides whether your RV fridge, converter and a fan stay on together. We sorted three small inverter generators by what each listing actually states for continuous output, then by weight, noise and runtime. This size suits a small camper or van with no rooftop air conditioner. If you want to start a 13,500 BTU unit, skip ahead to the larger wattage guides."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Running versus surge rating",
    "explanation": "Running watts are what the engine can sustain, while surge is a brief startup burst. A 2000W label that is really surge can trip when a fridge compressor and converter run together. Look for the words running or rated beside the number in the title or first bullet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Total load math",
    "explanation": "Add up the watts of everything you plan to run at once and keep the total under about 80% of the running rating. Sitting near the limit makes the engine labor and burns fuel faster. Check the nameplate wattage on each appliance, not the marketing line."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and handle design",
    "explanation": "Small inverter units still range from roughly 34 lb to well over 40 lb. A heavier unit is harder to lift into a truck bed alone. Read the weight line in the listing and confirm it is dry weight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise with distance stated",
    "explanation": "A dBA number means little without the distance and load. 57 or 60 dBA is typically quoted at 23 feet and at partial load. Look for the distance in the bullet, and treat bare numbers as optimistic."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Safety and expansion features",
    "explanation": "CO sensors and shutoff cut off the engine if exhaust builds near your campsite. Parallel ports let you pair a second unit later instead of buying a bigger one. Search the listing for CO and parallel wording before you buy."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 2000 watt generator run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Generally no, because rooftop units draw a startup surge above 2000 watts. Use it for fans, a fridge, lights and charging instead."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 2000 running watts the same as 2000 starting watts?",
    "a": "No. Starting watts are a short burst, and the continuous number is lower, as with the GENMAX GM2000i, which lists a starting figure only."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is parallel capability worth paying for?",
    "a": "If you might outgrow 2000W later, yes, since pairing two units is cheaper than replacing one. The BILT HARD 2500 lists parallel readiness."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep fuel fresh in a small tank?",
    "a": "Run the carburetor dry or add stabilizer before storage so gas does not gum the jets. Store the unit upright and ventilated."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are these safe to run near my camper?",
    "a": "Keep any generator outdoors and downwind, well away from windows and vents. A CO sensor helps, but it does not replace a working CO alarm inside."
