  "Almost every generator sold as a 2000 watt model reaches that number only for a few seconds. The figure on the box is usually starting (surge) watts, and the power you can draw all day, the running watts, is often 1,600 to 1,800. That gap decides whether your fridge, lights, laptop and a small appliance run together or the generator trips as soon as the microwave clicks on.",
  "We compared five 2000W-class inverter generators priced from $278.99 to $569 on the number that matters most, rated running watts, then on weight, published noise, the outlets that are actually on the panel, and how clearly the listing states what it can deliver. One rule shaped the ranking: a unit that publishes a real 2000 running-watt rating sits above one that only advertises 2000 as a peak."

It uses an 80cc four-stroke OHV engine, a 1.11-gallon tank that the listing says gives up to 5.5 hours at 50 percent load, pure sine wave output under 3 percent THD, two 120V NEMA 5-20 outlets and a 12V 8A DC output. A carbon monoxide sensor shuts the engine down automatically.\n\nIt ranks above the All Power America by 200 running watts for $21 more, and above the GENMAX by 400 running watts for $30 less. What it gives up is the weight and noise advantage of the GENMAX, because the listing publishes no weight or decibel figure, so you cannot confirm it is as light or quiet. The parallel kit is sold separately.\n\nPick it if you want the full 2000 watts as a continuous number, for example a compressor fridge plus lights and a laptop at once. The caveat is the missing weight and noise data, so check the carton dimensions before assuming it fits a tight bumper or bay compartment.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Running vs starting watts",
    "explanation": "Starting (surge) watts are what the generator can push for a few seconds to start a motor, while running watts are what it can supply continuously. A model advertised as 2000 watts but rated for 1,600 running watts will overload if you add a toaster to a fridge and charger. Find the word running or rated in the bullet points and size against that number, not the headline."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real outlets on the panel",
    "explanation": "A 2000W generator usually offers only 120V 20A duplex outlets, 12V DC and USB ports. A 30A TT-30 RV plug will not fit those outlets, so you need an adapter cord, and the 20A circuit then limits you to about 2,400 watts by arithmetic, more than the generator can deliver. Look at the outlet list in the listing for TT-30R or L5-30R before assuming direct RV plug-in."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Published weight and noise",
    "explanation": "Weight and decibel figures tell you whether the unit is carryable and campground friendly. Under 40 pounds is easy for one person, while a 60 dBA reading at 23 feet is comparable to conversation. Be careful when a listing omits both figures or states noise at no load, because noise rises with load, and compare the test load as well as the number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel type and storage",
    "explanation": "Gasoline degrades in a few months and clogs carburetors if left in the tank, while propane stores for years. A dual fuel model costs more, and typically produces less power on propane than on gasoline. Check the listing for a propane kit and for output on each fuel, and drain or stabilize gasoline before storing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide shutdown",
    "explanation": "Carbon monoxide builds up near campers, and a CO sensor that shuts the engine off can prevent poisoning. This is protection, not permission to run a generator near windows or an awning. Look for CO shutdown in the safety line of the listing, and always keep the generator outdoors and well away from the RV."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Parallel capability and warranty",
    "explanation": "Parallel kits connect two units to double output, which is the usual way a 2000W class generator reaches air conditioner power. The kit is typically sold separately and has to match the brand and model. Check whether the kit is included and confirm the warranty length, which one listing here states as two years while others do not."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 2000 watt generator run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Usually not on its own. A 13,500 BTU unit needs a starting surge well above 2,000 watts, and the 1,600 to 1,800 running watts most of these units deliver is below that. Two generators in parallel, or a soft start device, are the usual routes."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between 2000 starting watts and 2000 running watts?",
    "a": "Starting watts are a brief peak used when a motor kicks on, while running watts are continuous output. Here only the BILT HARD lists 2,000 running watts; the All Power America lists 1,800 and the GENMAX lists 1,600."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a dual fuel generator worth the extra money at this size?",
    "a": "Only if you value propane storage. The K&S 2000iHS costs $569, around $240 more than gas-only rivals, and the listing does not publish a separate running rating on propane."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a 2000W generator to a 30 amp RV?",
    "a": "Use a 20A-to-30A RV adapter cord into a 20A outlet, and keep the load under the generator's running rating. Turn off the RV air conditioner and large appliances before connecting, and plug in loads one at a time."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store the generator between trips?",
    "a": "Run the carburetor dry or add fuel stabilizer, change the oil per the manual, and store it dry and level. Propane on the K&S avoids the stale-fuel issue entirely."
