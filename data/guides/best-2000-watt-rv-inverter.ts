  "A 2000 watt inverter sounds like it can run a microwave and a coffee maker together, but the number on the box needs a second look. Continuous watts are what it can sustain, and surge watts are a short burst for starting motors, and all six units here list 4000W surge alongside 2000W continuous. The price of that power is on the battery side: at 12 volts, 2000 watts pulls roughly 167 amps, and with conversion losses closer to 200 amps from the bank, which sets the cable, fuse and battery requirements.",
  "We compared six 12V pure sine wave units from $169.99 to $329.90 on the figures each listing publishes: continuous and surge output, efficiency, included battery cables and remote, outlets, protections and extras such as a built-in transfer switch or battery charger. Two units step beyond a plain inverter, one with an automatic transfer switch and one with a charger, so the picks note when you are paying for a second function."

Against the LANDERPOW, it costs $59.50 more and uses thicker 1/0 AWG cables than the 2 AWG pair there.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are what the inverter can sustain, and surge is a short burst to start a motor or compressor. A 2000W inverter with a 4000W surge cannot run a 3000W load for long. Read the listing for both numbers, add up the continuous watts of everything you will run together, and leave headroom."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DC input amps",
    "explanation": "At 12 volts, 2000 watts draws roughly 167 amps from the battery, and with conversion losses about 200 amps, which is approximate physics, not a listing claim. That current needs thick cable, a correctly sized fuse and a bank that can deliver it. Check your battery's maximum continuous discharge rating before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable size and fuse",
    "explanation": "Thin or long cable drops voltage, heats up and can trigger a low-voltage shutdown at full load. The Renogy P2 supplies 1/0 AWG cables, while the LANDERPOW supplies 2 AWG, so check the gauge and length in the listing. Follow the inverter manual's cable and fuse chart, and keep the run short."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine wave output",
    "explanation": "Pure sine output matches household power and is safer for motors, microwaves and electronics, while modified sine can cause heat and noise. All six units here list pure sine. Confirm it in the title or the bullet points rather than assuming."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch or charger",
    "explanation": "A built-in transfer switch changes between shore power and the inverter automatically, and a charger refills the battery from shore or generator power. The Renogy PUH has a UPS transfer switch and the VEVOR is an inverter charger. If you already own a converter and a manual switch, you may not need these."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote, display and warranty",
    "explanation": "A remote lets you switch the inverter off from inside the coach, and a display shows battery and load. Cable lengths run from 15 ft to 32.8 ft in these listings, and warranty terms are mostly missing from the feature text. Check the remote cable length against the distance to your control spot and ask about warranty before buying."

  {
    "q": "What battery bank do I need?",
    "a": "A bank that can deliver roughly 200 amps continuously at 12V for a full 2000W load, which is an estimate from watts divided by volts with losses. Check the battery's maximum discharge rating rather than only its amp-hours."

    "q": "Is the Renogy PUH worth $85 more than the Renogy P2?",
    "a": "If you want shore-to-battery changeover without touching a switch, yes. The PUH adds a UPS transfer switch and Bluetooth. If you switch manually and want the included cables and a stated surge rating, the P2 costs less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire it safely?",
    "a": "Use the supplied cables or equal gauge, keep them short, fuse the positive cable close to the battery per the manual, and tighten every lug. Connect the inverter to the battery last, and make sure it is off first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does an inverter drain the battery when idle?",
    "a": "Many do draw some power with no load, but these listings do not publish a no-load figure in their features. Switch it off with the remote when you are not using AC."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep it running cool?",
    "a": "Leave clearance around the fans, avoid enclosed hot compartments and keep dust out of the vents. The LiTime lists dual fans and the Renogy PUH lists heat-sink fans, but all of them lose some power as heat at full load."
