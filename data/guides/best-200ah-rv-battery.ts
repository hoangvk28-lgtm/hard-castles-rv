  "Two batteries both labelled 12V 200Ah can differ by more than 20 pounds and by more than 1,000 watt-hours of energy you can really use. In lithium, 200Ah at 12.8 volts is 2,560 watt-hours and most of it is available. In lead-acid, the rating is usually quoted at a slow 20-hour discharge and drops sharply at heavier loads, and only about half is safe to use. So the amp-hour number is the start of the comparison, not the end of it.",
  "We compared six 200Ah options priced from $269.99 to $316.59: five LiFePO4 batteries and one AGM lead-acid as the cross-chemistry yardstick. Each is judged on usable watt-hours, listed weight and dimensions, the current the battery management system allows, and what the listing leaves unsaid. The aim is to show what 200Ah really means in a travel trailer, and which listings back the number with data."

The AGM's rating also assumes a slow 20-hour discharge, and the Renogy listing shows 152.9Ah at the 3-hour rate. Compare watt-hours at your own load, not the label."

    "criterion": "BMS continuous current",
    "explanation": "The battery management system caps output, and 150A at 12.8V supports about 1,920 watts while 200A supports about 2,560 watts. A 2,000-watt inverter at full draw pulls close to 190 amps, which can trip a 150A BMS. Look for the continuous figure, not just a peak, and read the title and bullets for contradictions."

  {
    "criterion": "Weight and listed ratios",
    "explanation": "Listings claim to be one third or one half the weight of lead-acid, which cannot both be true for the same 200Ah. The yeagulch's 58.86 pounds at one third implies about 177 pounds of lead-acid, and the E-LekTech's 50.5 pounds at one half implies about 101. Check the actual number in pounds and the AGM's data sheet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Physical size and fit",
    "explanation": "A 200Ah lithium can be 20 inches long like the yeagulch or about 13 like the E-LekTech listing, a volume difference of roughly 27 percent. A battery that does not fit the tray costs a bracket or a new box. Measure length, width, height and terminal location, and treat a surprisingly small listing as something to confirm."

    "criterion": "Cold behavior",
    "explanation": "Lithium pauses charging near 32°F, and the ECOBOSS publishes a 32°F to 113°F charge range and a restart at 41°F. Without that, a winter bank may refuse shore power or solar. Look for the numbers, and plan on AGM or a heated bay if you camp in freezing weather."

    "q": "Is one 200Ah battery better than two 100Ah?",
    "a": "A single 200Ah has fewer connections and one BMS, but that BMS must carry the full load. Two 100Ah batteries each carry half, and the ECOBOSS 200A rating needs to match your inverter. Choose by inverter size."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why do 200Ah lithium batteries weigh so differently?",
    "a": "Listings range from 50.5 to 58.86 pounds, and cell count, case design and BMS differ. A surprisingly light or small listing is worth confirming with the seller before purchase."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the ECOBOSS worth $29 more than the E-LekTech?",
    "a": "If you run a 2,000W or larger inverter, yes, because 200A continuous beats 150A. For a 1,000W inverter and a heated bay, the E-LekTech's 10-year warranty is better value."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run an air conditioner from one 200Ah battery?",
    "a": "Briefly. A 1,500W air conditioner draws about 117 amps at 12.8V, so 2,560Wh lasts roughly 1.4 hours at 80 percent usable, an estimate before inverter losses. Plan on shore power or a bigger bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I charge a 200Ah lithium battery from the converter?",
    "a": "Use a converter with a lithium mode near 14.4 to 14.6 volts, or a DC-DC charger. A lead-acid profile can leave the battery undercharged. Check the converter manual first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a 200Ah lithium battery in winter?",
    "a": "Store at about half charge, disconnected, in a space above the low-temperature limit if possible. Top it up every couple of months and avoid charging below 32°F."
