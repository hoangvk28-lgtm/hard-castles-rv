  "Search for a 30 amp RV converter and you will find two different products sharing one label. Some units put out 30 amps of 12V DC, which suits a small trailer with one battery. Others are power centers sold for 30 amp rigs, meaning the AC panel is sized for a 30 amp shore cord, and their built-in converter actually puts out 35 amps of DC. Buying the wrong kind means a panel that does not fit the cutout or a charger far smaller than the battery wants.",
  "We compared six listings from $95.88 to $213 and sorted them by what they really publish: the DC output, the charge voltages, whether lithium has its own mode, and what factory part they replace. Three are Progressive Dynamics 9200 and 9300 series converter sections or lookalikes, and three are WF-8735 style power centers. Each pick below says which of the two jobs it does, so you can match it to the failed part in your rig."

Its listing describes four modes shown by colored lights: a flooded lead-acid mode that boosts to about 14.4 volts, a two-stage lithium mode that idles at 13.6 volts, an AGM mode that absorbs at 14.7 volts, and a constant 13.6 volt mode. It is priced at $213.\n\nIt ranks first because it is the only unit here from the original brand that publishes a dedicated lithium mode and a constant-voltage mode for running loads without a battery. The price is $103 above the UIGEFAV PD9330 and $93 above the Rugaest PD9230, which are lookalike boxes that list lead-acid chemistries only. Against the WFCO power center it gives less DC output, 30 amps versus 35, but swaps a single converter instead of a whole panel.\n\nPick this if you are replacing a failed 9300 series converter or want a lithium-aware 30 amp box without changing the rest of the panel. The caveat is that the listing does not state dimensions or a warranty term in its feature text, and it needs the matching 9300 series bay.",

    "criterion": "Series and cutout match",
    "explanation": "Factory 9200, 9300 and WF-8700 bays differ in connector layout, mounting holes and cutout size. A part that fits the wrong series means cutting, extending wires or abandoning the swap. Photograph your existing unit and its label, then match the series name in the listing before ordering."

  {
    "criterion": "Protections and listing marks",
    "explanation": "A safety listing such as UL/CSA means an outside lab reviewed the design, which a list of internal protections does not guarantee. Among these six, only the genuine WFCO states UL/CSA and FCC compliance in its feature text. Look for the listing mark by name, and if it is absent, expect to rely on the seller's return policy."

    "q": "Is a 30 amp converter the same as a 30 amp power center?",
    "a": "No. A converter section outputs a set number of DC amps, while a power center combines the converter with AC and DC distribution for a 30 amp shore cord. The WF-8735 style center on this list outputs 35 amps DC from a 30 amp panel. Match the part to what is on your wall."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a 30 amp converter charge a lithium battery correctly?",
    "a": "Only if it has a lithium or LiFePO4 profile. The PD9330V and the WFCO 8735 list one, and the SIYOEN lists a numbered lithium output. The UIGEFAV PD9330, the Rugaest PD9230 and the PeiXWming 8735 list lead-acid types only."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the genuine WFCO worth about double the lookalike price?",
    "a": "It is if you camp at weak-voltage sites or want a safety listing, since the genuine unit states full output down to 100 volts and UL/CSA marks. If you have a lead-acid bank and a stable hookup, the $96 to $120 boxes do the basic job."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I check which series my rig has?",
    "a": "Read the label on the existing converter or power center, and look for 9200, 9300 or WF-8700 in the model number. Compare the cutout size and connector layout to the listing, and photograph the wiring before you pull anything."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a 30 amp converter with a large lithium bank?",
    "a": "It will work but slowly, because 30 amps against a 200Ah bank takes many hours to fill, and the DC loads in the rig eat into that. For banks over 100Ah consider the 45 amp or larger sizes covered in our other converter guides."
  },
  {
    "q": "What should I check on a converter once a season?",
    "a": "Look at the fan for dust, check that DC lugs are tight and not discolored, and confirm the charge voltage with a meter against the stated float figure. A loose lug is the most common cause of heat and voltage drop."
