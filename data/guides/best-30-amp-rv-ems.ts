Its listing says circuit analysis shuts off power in an emergency, adds a built-in 90 second power-on delay after a fault, and sends smartphone alerts for open ground, open neutral, reverse polarity and open circuit.\n\nIt ranks first because it states both an automatic shutoff and a restart delay, which protects an air conditioner compressor.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic shutoff",
    "explanation": "An EMS cuts power when voltage or wiring goes bad, instead of only warning you. This matters because a low-voltage brownout can overheat an air conditioner motor within minutes. The Power Watchdog PWD30 listing says it shuts down power in a dangerous event, so look for the same wording and for over and under voltage protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Restart delay",
    "explanation": "After a fault, many EMS units wait before restoring power so a compressor does not restart against residual pressure. A delay of a minute or two is normal and is not a defect. The Power Watchdog PWD30 lists a 90 second delay, so search the listing for power-on delay or reconnect delay."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "30 amp wattage limit",
    "explanation": "A 30 amp, 120 volt circuit tops out near 3,600 watts, so a microwave and an air conditioner can trip the pedestal breaker together. A display showing amps or watts lets you manage that load. Check whether the listing shows live current and watts, as the ENDMAN 30A Meter does."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Single-leg protection",
    "explanation": "A 30 amp rig uses one 120 volt leg through a TT-30 plug, so a 30 amp unit only has one leg to monitor. If you plug a 30 amp unit into a 50 amp pedestal with an adapter, the other leg is not part of that path. Match the unit to the plug your rig actually uses."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Replaceable surge module",
    "explanation": "After a big spike, a surge-only module can be spent while the rest of the unit works fine. The Power Watchdog PWD30 lists a replaceable surge module, so you buy a new module instead of a new unit. Look for replaceable module wording if you camp in storm-prone areas."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Portable or hardwired",
    "explanation": "Portable units plug in at the pedestal, where theft and weather are risks, and some include a locking bracket. A hardwired unit lives inside the coach but needs wiring. The Progressive LCHW30 is the hardwired pick here, so check how you plan to secure whichever you buy."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a 30 amp EMS or will a surge protector do?",
    "a": "If your rig has an air conditioner, an EMS is worth it, because voltage faults damage motors and a surge-only unit will not disconnect. The Progressive PT30X Portable lists those protections, while the Southwire 30A lists a tester and monitor."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do 30 amp owners make?",
    "a": "They buy by joules and ignore shutoff. A 12,000 joule unit like the ENDMAN 30A Meter shows low voltage but does not describe cutting power, so it cannot replace a true EMS."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Power Watchdog PWD30 worth it over the Progressive PT30X Portable?",
    "a": "If you want a phone app, amp readout and a stated 90 second restart delay, yes. If you only want a named fault list at a lower price, the Progressive PT30X Portable is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a 30 amp EMS?",
    "a": "Switch the pedestal breaker off, plug the EMS into the TT-30 outlet, attach your cord, then switch the breaker on and read the indicators. If the unit reports a fault, move to another site."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I care for it?",
    "a": "Wipe the plug blades and check them for discoloration each season. After a big surge, replace the surge module on units that offer one, such as the Power Watchdog PWD30."
