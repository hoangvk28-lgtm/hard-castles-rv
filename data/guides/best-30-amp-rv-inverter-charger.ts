  "A real 30 amp RV inverter charger combines an inverter, a battery charger and an AC transfer switch that passes shore or generator power through at 30A. Plenty of listings that mention 30A are only a solar controller or a standalone transfer switch. We kept the one product that is actually a 3000W inverter charger with a 30A single-leg transfer switch. The sections below show how to judge pass-through rating and charger output yourself."

It combines inverter, charger and transfer switch in one box and adds improved AC pass-through behavior with over-the-air firmware updates. It carries a 3-year support plan.\n\nIt stands alone here because the other 30A listings were solar controllers or transfer switches, not true inverter chargers. Pick this if your rig has 30A shore power and you want one box to replace a separate inverter and converter. The caveat is that the listing does not state charger amps, idle draw or efficiency, so check the manual.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "30A pass-through rating",
    "explanation": "This is the amperage the transfer switch can carry from shore power to your panel. A switch rated below 30A will overheat when the air conditioner and microwave run together. Look for a stated 30A transfer or pass-through spec."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are what the inverter can hold for hours, while surge only covers a few seconds of startup. A 3000W label with 1500W continuous cannot run an air conditioner. Check that the listing says rated or continuous."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger current and profile",
    "explanation": "Charger amps decide how fast the bank refills on shore power. A small charger takes a full day on a 200Ah bank. Find charger amps and lithium support in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Idle draw",
    "explanation": "Inverters burn power even with nothing plugged in, sometimes 20 to 40 watts. Over a day that drains a battery silently. Look for a no-load draw number and a sleep mode."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Single-leg or split-phase",
    "explanation": "A single-leg unit serves one 120V hot line, which matches 30A RVs. A 50A rig uses two hot legs and needs a split-phase design. Confirm the term single-leg in the listing."

];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is the Go Power 3000W good for a 50A RV?",
    "a": "It is a single-leg 30A design, so it fits 30A RVs directly. A 50A split-phase rig needs a different transfer arrangement."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does it need a separate transfer switch?",
    "a": "No, the Go Power 3000W includes the transfer switch. That is what separates a true inverter charger from the stand-alone switches also sold for 30A."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can it run an air conditioner?",
    "a": "The 3000W rating gives room, but the listing does not state continuous versus surge. Check the manual and your air conditioner's startup amps first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why not a solar inverter with a 30A controller?",
    "a": "A 30A MPPT figure describes solar input, not AC pass-through. Those products can charge from panels but do not give you 30A shore transfer."
