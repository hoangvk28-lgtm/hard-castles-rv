  "Three hundred watts is where an RV solar setup stops being a trickle charger and starts covering a real day. At 5 peak sun hours the nameplate math gives 1,500 watt-hours, and after an estimated 25 percent loss to heat, wiring and the controller you can plan on about 1,125. That is enough for a compressor fridge, lights, a water pump, laptops and a few hours of fan, but not for an air conditioner.",
  "The catch is that a 300W listing can mean three different things: one large rigid panel, a set of smaller panels sold as a kit, or a folding portable panel with a handle. We compared six, from $41.59 to $386.98, on what the 300 watts is made of, how much space it takes folded or mounted, what controller comes with it, and whether the price makes sense for the hardware."

The frame is aluminum with an IP65 plus rating, rated for 2,400 Pa wind and 5,400 Pa snow, and the junction box has a built-in bypass diode. The listing says it works with 12V batteries wired in parallel or 24V batteries in series, and the controller handles four battery types.\n\nIt ranks first because it is the only pick that is rigid, complete and aimed at a permanent roof or ground install in one purchase. It costs $110.00 more than the Mndstek 18BB panel, which has no controller, and $93.08 less than the Renogy portable. The bundled controller is the reason: buying a basic one separately narrows the gap. The listing does not name the controller type, so we cannot say whether it is PWM or MPPT.\n\nPick this if you want a fixed 300W array and a matched controller without sourcing parts separately. The caveat is the unnamed controller, which matters because PWM gives up a chunk of output on a 12V battery with a higher-voltage array.",

Against the Mndstek 10BB, which sells at the same $169.99, it has the higher-resolution 18-busbar layout but a slightly lower efficiency figure of 24.6 versus 25 percent, so the two are close and the choice is about detail.

  {
    "criterion": "One panel or several",
    "explanation": "A 300W listing may be a single large panel or three 100W panels, and the difference decides roof layout, wiring and shade behavior. One large panel is fewer connections, but a single shaded corner can cut a whole string, while smaller panels let you isolate shade. Look for the panel count and dimensions in the title or bullets, and ask the seller if they are missing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Daily watt-hours by sun hours",
    "explanation": "Nameplate watts times peak sun hours gives the ceiling, so 300W gives 900, 1,500 or 2,100 watt-hours at 3, 5 or 7 hours. Heat, wiring and controller losses typically take about a quarter, so plan around 675, 1,125 and 1,575. Check the sun hours for your region and season, since winter in the north can fall under 3."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller type and amp rating",
    "explanation": "A PWM controller pulls the panel down to battery voltage and wastes the difference, while MPPT converts the extra voltage into current. At 300W and 12V the array makes about 22 to 25 amps, so a 30A MPPT controller is a safe fit. Look for the controller type spelled out, and be cautious if the listing says only smart or intelligent."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage and cold-weather Voc",
    "explanation": "A panel's open-circuit voltage rises in cold weather, sometimes by 10 to 15 percent, and if series strings exceed the controller's input limit it can fail. Three 100W panels in series add their voltages, while in parallel they add current. Check the Voc on the panel label, correct it for your coldest morning, and compare against the controller's maximum input."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and folded size",
    "explanation": "A 300W portable that weighs 15 to 19 pounds is easy to carry, but you also need a place to store it, and a rigid roof panel adds load and wind drag. Folded dimensions, like 20 by 38 inches, tell you if it fits a bay or under a bed. Look for exact weight and size, and reject listings that give neither."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Evidence behind the spec",
    "explanation": "Terms like A+ cells, 100 percent EL testing and IP68 are claims you can only weigh if the listing gives details. Wind and snow load ratings, such as 2,400 and 5,400 Pa, are concrete. Prefer the listing that publishes testing and ratings, and treat a price far under the rest as a reason to verify output on arrival."

    "q": "How many amps does a 300 watt solar panel make?",
    "a": "At 12V nominal it is about 25 amps from 300W, and about 22 amps when charging at 13.5 volts. Real output is lower due to heat and losses. Size the controller and wire for at least 30A."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is one 300W panel better than three 100W panels?",
    "a": "One panel has fewer connections and a smaller total footprint, while three 100W panels can be wired to reduce shade loss and are easier to carry. On a cluttered roof the three-panel layout usually fits better. If your roof has a clear 40 by 65 inch space, one large panel is simpler."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a 300W panel run my RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Not by itself. A typical RV air conditioner draws 1,200 to 1,800 watts while running, far over what 300W of panels delivers. It could only run for short periods from a large battery bank with an inverter."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need MPPT for a 300W array?",
    "a": "It is strongly worth it. An MPPT controller recovers the voltage difference between panel and battery, often giving 15 to 30 percent more than PWM on a 12V system. The bundled controllers in the WUZECK and DOKIO listings do not clearly say MPPT."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a folding 300W panel to a power station?",
    "a": "Check the station's maximum solar input in watts and volts first. If it caps at 200W, a 300W panel will simply produce less than its rating. Use the matching connector adapter from the station maker."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I clean and maintain a 300W panel?",
    "a": "Rinse dust with water and a soft cloth, and avoid abrasives that scratch the coating. Check connector seals and mounting bolts a couple of times a year, and fold portable panels carefully to protect the cells."
