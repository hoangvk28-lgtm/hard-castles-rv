  "A 3000 watt portable power station is the first class that can plausibly stand in for a generator at a campsite: it can run an RV roof air conditioner on a hot afternoon, a microwave and a coffee maker together, or a fridge, TV and laptop all at once. Three of the six here also have a built-in 30-amp TT-30 outlet, the plug an RV shore cord uses, which is the detail most competitor roundups skip. Be careful with the label: several 3000W stations on Amazon are really 2000W continuous with a 3000W peak, and we left those out.",
  "We compared six stations from $899 to $2,599 that list 3000W as the rated AC output, and checked stored watt-hours, TT-30 availability, AC input speed, expansion, cycle rating and warranty, noting plainly where a listing leaves a number out. The batteries run from 2,042Wh to 3,072Wh, so even at 3000W the runtime is short: about 40 minutes at full load, and hours at a normal camper load. If you only need 2000W, the 2000 watt guide is cheaper."

    "explanation": "Expansion battery packs are sold separately and only work with the matching main unit. Parallel systems can double the output to 6000W. Confirm pack prices before counting on expansion."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty and documentation",
    "explanation": "Stated warranties here run from 5 years to 7 years of support, and some listings give none. A heavy 3000W station needs a clear warranty. Look for the term and the weight."

  {
    "q": "What can a 3000 watt portable power station run in an RV?",
    "a": "A roof air conditioner, microwave, coffee maker, fridge and TV can run together if the combined load stays under 3000W. A TT-30 unit can feed the camper's circuit. Watch the battery, because 3000W drains it in under an hour."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a TT-30 and why does it matter?",
    "a": "TT-30 is the 30-amp, 120V plug used on many RV shore cords. A station with one can connect to the camper's panel. The Dabbsson 3000L and AFERIY P300 list one."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Dabbsson 3000L worth $130 more than the AFERIY?",
    "a": "If you want 1,024Wh more battery, yes. If you only run short bursts, the AFERIY at $899 gives 3000W and a TT-30 for less. The Dabbsson gives a 5-year warranty."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I recharge it while driving?",
    "a": "The Dabbsson bundle with the 560W Charger S is built for it, while others rely on the 12V socket or solar. Alternator charging needs correct wiring."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does 3,072Wh last at 1,500W?",
    "a": "Roughly 1.7 hours after losses, as an estimate. A 100W camper load lasts about a day and a half."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store it?",
    "a": "Keep it indoors at a partial charge and top it up every few months. Avoid heat."
