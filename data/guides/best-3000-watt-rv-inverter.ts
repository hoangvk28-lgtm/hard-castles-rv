  "A 3000W inverter on a 12V system is a heavy-duty machine: at full load it draws about 250A, roughly 280A after conversion losses. That much current needs welding-grade cable, a large DC fuse, and a battery bank whose management system can deliver it, which rules out most single batteries. The AC side is also demanding, since 3000W at 120V is 25A, more than a standard 15A or 20A household circuit.",
  "We compared six 3000W pure sine units priced from $179.99 to $798. Four are plain inverters and two add a charger and transfer switch. The decision is less about the wattage, which is the same in all six, and more about certification, what the listing says about surge, whether you need a charger, and whether your 12V battery system can support this size at all."

    "explanation": "At 3000W a 12V inverter draws about 250A, and roughly 280A with conversion losses. A single lithium battery with a 100A or 200A BMS will shut down, so you need parallel batteries or a 300A-class BMS. Compare the inverter's full-load amps with the combined continuous rating of your bank."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable, fuse and busbar",
    "explanation": "Carrying 280A needs very thick cable, such as the 1AWG-class pairs that ship with some 3000W models, a large DC fuse and a bus bar rated for it. Undersized cable heats up, drops voltage and trips the low-voltage cutoff. Keep the cable run to a couple of feet and follow the manual."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge duration",
    "explanation": "A 6000W rating suits a window air conditioner or compressor start, but only for a moment. No listing in this guide gives the duration, so a motor that struggles might fault the inverter. Ask the seller for the surge time before depending on it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certification",
    "explanation": "UL 458 is the standard for power converters in vehicles, and CSA C22.2 No. 107.1 is its Canadian counterpart. A named standard gives insurers and installers something to check. Look for the standard in the listing text, and treat claims without names as unverified."

  {
    "criterion": "Charger and transfer switch",
    "explanation": "An inverter charger replaces both a converter and a transfer switch, but charge amps and chemistry matter. The ACOPOWER listing says 120A in the title and 50A in a bullet, which shows why you should confirm. Look for the stated amps and a lithium profile."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC circuit capacity",
    "explanation": "3000W at 120V is 25A, more than a 15A or 20A household circuit. The unit's outlets are typically 20A each, so the total depends on the terminals and wiring. Plan separate circuits or a terminal block, and have a qualified installer wire it."

    "q": "What is the difference between an inverter and an inverter charger?",
    "a": "An inverter only makes AC from the battery. An inverter charger like the Femotic 3000W also charges the battery from shore power and switches over automatically."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire a 3000W inverter safely?",
    "a": "Use the manufacturer's cable gauge, a fuse near the battery rated for the load, short runs and torqued lugs. Hardwiring to AC circuits should be done by a licensed electrician."
