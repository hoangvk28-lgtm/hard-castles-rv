export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does the 3000w portable power stations wattage figure always mean continuous output?",
    "a": "Not always. Some listings blend surge or boost mode figures into the headline wattage number, so verify the continuous, sustained rating separately before assuming a station can run a device at that power level indefinitely."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can two stations with the same wattage rating have very different runtimes?",
    "a": "Yes, significantly. Wattage describes how much power a station can deliver at once, while watt-hours describe how long it can sustain that delivery, so always check battery capacity alongside the wattage rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?",
    "a": "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use any solar panel with a portable power station?",
    "a": "Not always. Some manufacturers restrict compatibility to their own branded panels or require a specific voltage and connector type, so check the station's documented solar input specs and connector type before assuming a third-party panel will work."
