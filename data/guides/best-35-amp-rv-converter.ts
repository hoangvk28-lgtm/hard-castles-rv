  "A 35 amp converter is the quiet middle of the RV market: big enough to run the pump, vent fans and lights while pushing real current into a single group 27 battery, and small enough to be passively cheap. It is also the size many older WFCO 8935 and Parallax 6336 sections were built to, so a lot of buyers are replacing a dead 35 amp part, not designing a new system. At 35 amps and roughly 13.6 volts the unit is moving close to 480 watts of DC, which is why fan behavior and fit matter more than the label.",
  "We compared six 35 amp units priced from $61.90 to $319.45, looking at what each listing really commits to: the charge stages, whether lithium is handled, the fixed voltages, and the named factory sections they replace. The spread is wide for a reason. Two are legacy-brand sections that name exact replacements, three are aftermarket boxes with modern charge modes, and one is a power supply whose listing is mostly about electronics, not RV setup."

The cost is $179 above the PowerMax PM4-35A and $231 above the VEVOR 35A, and in return you do not get a published lithium mode, since the listing text is silent on chemistries other than lead-acid. Against the Parallax 4435 at $319.45, it is $26 cheaper and describes its charging better.\n\nPick this if you are matching a failed WFCO 8935 or Parallax 6336 section in a lead-acid rig and want a recognized brand.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Bank size against 35 amps",
    "explanation": "A 35 amp converter delivers its charge current only after the rig's own DC loads, so a pump and a furnace fan can leave less than 20 amps for the battery. A 100Ah lithium bank at that rate needs several hours, and a larger bank needs a bigger unit. Look up your battery's capacity and the converter's output, then expect about half the output to reach the battery while loads run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Exact section replaced",
    "explanation": "Older RVs use sections named WFCO 8935 or Parallax 6336, and the replacement has to match the bay's connectors and holes. A mismatch means cutting and rewiring. Check your existing label for the model, then look for that model name in the listing's replacement text."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge voltage selection",
    "explanation": "A lithium bank wants a set absorb voltage around 14.4 to 14.6 volts and no equalization stage, which a flooded-battery cycle includes. A unit with only a fixed 13.75 volt output will undercharge lithium. Look for numbered voltage steps in the listing and match them against the battery maker's charge spec."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fan behavior",
    "explanation": "At 35 amps a converter makes real heat, and a fan that runs only when the unit is warm keeps a van quiet at night. Forced-air models run a fan more often and can be heard. Look for words like temperature-controlled or runs only when needed, and plan clearance around the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mislabeled voltage modes",
    "explanation": "Several aftermarket units list a 16.5 volt fixed mode, which suits equipment powering, not a battery. If the selector is left there, the battery will be overcharged and can be damaged. Learn which switch position is which, and put a label near the unit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Listing detail versus price",
    "explanation": "The most expensive unit here, the Parallax 4435, publishes the least: package size, weight and a part number. A thin listing means you rely on the seller for output and charge specs. Compare the amount of electrical detail in each listing to its price before paying a premium."

    "q": "Will a 35 amp converter handle a lithium battery?",
    "a": "Only with the right voltage. The PowerMax PM4-35A has an adjustable output, the RecPro and VEVOR offer a 14.6 volt step, and the Fortron and PD4635V list no lithium setting. Confirm the voltage against your battery's spec."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Progressive PD4635V worth $179 over the PowerMax?",
    "a": "Only if you want a named drop-in for a WFCO 8935 or Parallax 6336 bay and a legacy brand. For a new install or a lithium bank, the PowerMax PM4-35A at $114 does more for less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set the VEVOR or RecPro for LiFePO4?",
    "a": "Pick the lithium mode on the VEVOR or the 14.6 volt step on either, then confirm that matches the battery maker's absorb voltage. Never leave the 16.5 volt step selected."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will 35 amps take to charge my battery?",
    "a": "As arithmetic, a 100Ah battery that is half empty needs about 50Ah, and at an effective 20 amps that is roughly two and a half hours. Real time is longer because charge tapers near full."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep the converter from overheating?",
    "a": "Leave the clearance the manual calls for, keep vents free of dust, and avoid stacking it under a mattress or in a closed cabinet. A temperature-controlled fan only helps if air can get in and out."
