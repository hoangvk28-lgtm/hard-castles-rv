Next to the DUMPMAN 20 Ft Kit, it adds ten feet of reach and removes the clear elbow.\n\nBest for sites with a very distant riser who plan to add a short extension.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Sold length versus need",
    "explanation": "A 35 foot route cannot be met by either hose alone, because the longest single hose is 30 feet. That leaves a gap of five feet to bridge. Measure the route and plan the extra reach."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "One piece versus joined",
    "explanation": "One-piece hoses have fewer leak points than joined sections. Joining two hoses adds a coupling and a gasket to maintain. Choose compatible parts only."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wall thickness",
    "explanation": "The DUMPMAN lists a 24 mil TPE wall, and a thick wall resists wear on long drags. Long hoses scrape more ground than short ones. Look for the mil figure on any hose you add."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Elbow and fittings",
    "explanation": "A clear 4-in-1 style elbow fits several inlet sizes. The AVERONR lists none, so plan one for the dump end. Check the contents list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Slope and support",
    "explanation": "A long hose needs a steady downhill run or it holds waste in the sags. Plan support points along the route. Do not rely on length alone."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is there a 35 ft RV sewer hose?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I join hoses to reach 35 feet?",
    "a": "Join compatible hose sections only, with matching fittings. Do not mix macerator hoses with gravity hoses. Check the lug and bayonet ends first."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake costs the most?",
    "a": "Buying a hose that is just short and stretching it. Stretch pulls fittings loose and breaks seals. Add slack to the route."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the longer hose worth it?",
    "a": "If the route is long, yes. The AVERONR 30 Ft Hose adds ten feet over the DUMPMAN 20 Ft Kit. For a shorter route, save the money."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store long hoses?",
    "a": "Collapse, cap and keep them in a large carrier. Rinse each hose first. Keep both ends capped to avoid odor."
