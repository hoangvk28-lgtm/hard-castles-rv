Prices span $279 to $399.99, so we checked what each extra dollar buys before ranking them."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Running watts at 3500",
    "explanation": "A 3500W label can still be a 3000W continuous generator, as with the maXpeedingrods 3500. For air conditioning that gap matters when other loads share the circuit. Look for the running watts line in the title or specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "30A RV outlet",
    "explanation": "A TT-30 style outlet lets you plug a 30 amp RV cord in directly instead of using an adapter. With adapters you are limited by the weaker outlet. Confirm the listing names a 30A RV receptacle."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Runtime at stated load",
    "explanation": "A 3 gallon tank and an 8.3 hour Eco rating are not comparable unless the load is stated. Half load runtime is typically shorter than quarter load. Find the percent load next to each runtime number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Open frame versus enclosed",
    "explanation": "Open frame units cost less and are easier to cool but are usually louder and less weather sheltered. Campground quiet rules make this a real consideration. Look for the word open frame in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Safety shutoff features",
    "explanation": "CO sensors and low oil shutoff protect you and the engine. Not every budget listing includes them. Search the listing for CO and oil sensor wording before buying."

export const faq = [

    "q": "Can a 3500 watt inverter generator run an RV air conditioner?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Why do these list different peak watts at the same 3500 size?",
    "a": "Makers use different surge ratings, as the All Power America 3500 shows with 4375 peak. Compare running watts instead."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 3 gallon tank worth it?",
    "a": "It cuts refueling during long outages, but a bigger tank also adds weight. The All Power America 3500 has the largest tank here."
