export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What four sensors cover",
    "explanation": "Four sensors cover a tandem-axle trailer, a pickup or a small motorhome with single rear wheels. A truck and trailer together need eight, and duallies need more. Count every tire before choosing a four-sensor set."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pressure range",
    "explanation": "A four-sensor set is only useful if it can read your tires. The Tymate TM2 4-Set stops at 87 psi, while the Tymate TM3 4-Set and Tymate TM7 4-Set read to 144 psi. Check the listing's psi against your tire's maximum."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sensor battery type",
    "explanation": "Cap sensors with replaceable CR1632 batteries, as on the RVenture 4-Sensor, can be refreshed for a few dollars. Sealed sensors must be replaced when the battery dies. Check whether the listing names the battery."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Repeater and range",
    "explanation": "The signal must reach the cab from the trailer. The RVenture 4-Sensor includes a repeater, and the Tymate sets list extended transmission. Check the stated range against your trailer length."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Display and power",
    "explanation": "A widescreen display is easier to read, and solar or USB power avoids wiring. The RVenture 4-Sensor uses a 5 inch screen with a magnetic mount. Look for backlight and charging details."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Expandability",
    "explanation": "Some displays can add sensors later, while a four-tire kit may be a dead end. If you may add a truck or spare, ask about expansion. Check the tire count the display handles."

  {
    "q": "Is the RVenture 4-Sensor worth it over the Tymate TM3 4-Set?",

  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install four sensors?",

    "q": "How do I maintain them?",
