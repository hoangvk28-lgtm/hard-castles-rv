  "A 4,000 watt generator sounds like it would run a 30 amp trailer with room to spare, but the plug tells a different story: 30 amps at 120 volts is 3,600 watts, so about 400 watts, roughly 3.3 amps, of a true 4,000 watt generator cannot leave through the TT-30 plug and is only usable on the 20 amp outlets. That is the first thing to know before paying for the extra wattage. The second is that plenty of listings titled 4000W are rated at 3,200 running watts with 4,000 as a peak, which is a lower class.",
  "We kept only generators whose listing gives 4,000 as a rated or running figure, which excludes the many 4,000 peak models, and found five between $329.99 and $647. Two are WEN dual-fuel and gas models, and three are open-frame inverter generators that list 5,000 peak and 4,000 running watts. The picks differ more in fuel, noise, plug and support than in power, so that is how the comparison is organized."

It is the only pick here that holds 4,000 watts on both fuels.\n\nAt $647 it is $12.01 above the WEN 56477i ($634.99), which has the same output on gasoline only, and the extra dollars buy propane operation. It is $157.01 above the Mutaomay 4000 ($489.99) and $317.01 above the Oxseryn 4000 ($329.99). In exchange you get a native TT-30R and a CO shutdown sensor that the Oxseryn listing does not mention. The listing compares its noise to a normal conversation without giving a decibel figure.\n\nPick this if you want 4,000 sustained watts on gasoline or a propane tank and a proper RV plug. The caveat is that weight and dimensions are not stated, and as with any 4,000 watt unit, only 3,600 of them can pass through the TT-30 plug.",

    "explanation": "Many listings headlined 4000W are rated 3,200 running, with 4,000 as a peak that lasts seconds, so they sit in a lower class. Running or rated watts is what you can use continuously. Look for the line with the word running or rated next to 4,000, not the title."

  {
    "criterion": "The 3,600W plug ceiling",
    "explanation": "A 30 amp TT-30 plug carries 30 amps at 120 volts, which is 3,600 watts, so a 4,000 watt generator has about 400 watts it cannot send through that plug. The surplus only helps on the 20 amp outlets. Add your running loads, and confirm the sum stays below 3,600 on the trailer cord."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "TT-30R versus a generic RV port",
    "explanation": "A TT-30R receptacle accepts a trailer cord directly, whereas an unspecified 30A or RV port may be a twist-lock. Only the WEN models and the Mutaomay name a TT-30R. Look for the receptacle code in the listing and budget for a rated adapter if it is missing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual-fuel wattage",
    "explanation": "Propane normally lowers a generator's wattage, but the WEN DF480iX keeps 4,000 rated on both fuels, which is unusual. If you plan to run on propane, check the propane rating rather than assuming it matches gasoline. Look for a separate propane line in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise and the test conditions",
    "explanation": "Stated decibel levels are measured at 23 feet at a particular load, and they rise with the load. The Mutaomay lists under 64.5 dB and the Oxseryn 70 dBA, a difference you can hear at a quiet campground. Compare the same load and distance before comparing figures."

The WEN 56477i lists a three-year warranty, and the others state none in their bullets. Check the product page for anything the bullets omit before buying."

  },
  {
    "q": "Why are so many 4000 watt generators only 3,200 running watts?",

    "q": "Is the WEN DF480iX worth the extra money over the 56477i?",
