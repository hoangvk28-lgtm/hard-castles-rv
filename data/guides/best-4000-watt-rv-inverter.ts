  "A 4000W inverter on a 12V battery is at the edge of what that voltage can sensibly do. Full load pulls about 333A before losses, and roughly 360A to 370A after them, which is welding-cable territory and well past what most lithium batteries will deliver from a single unit. The AC side is 33A at 120V, so no ordinary household outlet can carry the full output.",
  "We compared six 4000W pure sine models from $174.99 to $419.95. All claim 8000W peak except one with a 7000W figure, so the real differences are how long the surge lasts, whether the low-voltage cutoff can be tuned to your battery, what is in the box, and how much documentation the seller gives. For most RVs the honest alternative is a lower wattage, and we point out when a smaller guide fits better."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "DC current at 4000W",
    "explanation": "A 4000W load at 12V is about 333A, and about 358A at the 93 percent efficiency the DEECHI states. Very few batteries can supply that continuously, so you need parallel batteries or a big bank. Compare the inverter's full-load amps with the combined BMS continuous rating before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable, fuse and voltage drop",
    "explanation": "At 350A, cable length matters, because every foot adds resistance and voltage drop that may trip the low-voltage cutoff. Use the thickest cable you can fit, keep it short, and fuse close to the battery. The SUNWHEEL ships fuses and four cables, which is useful at this size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge duration",
    "explanation": "An 8000W peak sounds like an air-conditioner starter, but without a duration it is a marketing figure. The Giandel states 7000W for 2 seconds, which is honest but brief. Ask the seller for the duration, and size continuous power for your largest load instead."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Adjustable low-voltage cutoff",
    "explanation": "The cutoff decides when the inverter shuts down to protect the battery. Lithium can run lower, around 10V under load, while lead-acid needs to stop higher to avoid damage. Look for an adjustable range such as the OLTEANP's 9.5V to 11V."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "AC side: 33A at 120V",
    "explanation": "4000W at 120V is about 33A, more than a 20A outlet or breaker. The inverter's outlets share the load, but a single circuit cannot carry the full output. Plan multiple circuits and have an electrician do hardwiring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Whether you need 4000W at all",
    "explanation": "Most RV loads fit within 2000W to 3000W, and the cost of 12V cable and batteries rises steeply above that. Add up your running watts first. If the total is under 3000W, the smaller guide on this site is cheaper to install."

];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 4000W inverter run two air conditioners?",
    "a": "Rarely. Two rooftop units can need several thousand watts running, plus a large startup surge. With 12V the battery current is also extreme. Most owners with two air conditioners use a higher voltage system or a generator."
  },
  {
    "q": "What battery bank do I need for a 4000W inverter?",
    "a": "Plan for 360A at full load, so several lithium batteries in parallel with high BMS ratings. Four 100Ah batteries sharing the load can work if each supports 100A or more."

    "q": "Is the Giandel 4000W worth $244.96 more than the DEECHI?",

    "q": "Do I need a 24V or 48V system instead?",
    "a": "For 4000W, many installers recommend 24V or 48V, because current is halved or quartered. These are 12V units, so you accept about 360A and heavy cable."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I size the fuse?",
    "a": "Follow the manual. In general the fuse is rated just above full-load current and sits within inches of the battery positive terminal. Use a DC-rated fuse designed for several hundred amps."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I leave a 4000W inverter on?",
    "a": "It will draw its idle current continuously, which drains the battery over days. Switch it off with the remote when not in use."
