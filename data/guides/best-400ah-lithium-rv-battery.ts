  "A 12V 400Ah lithium bank holds about 5,120 watt-hours, enough to run a compressor fridge, lights, a water pump and a laptop for several days or to power a 2,000-watt inverter for roughly two and a half hours. Very few makers sell a single 400Ah battery, so this size is usually reached by wiring batteries in parallel. We therefore state clearly what you get in each pick: one of the six here is a single 400Ah battery, three are two-battery 200Ah kits, and two are four-battery 100Ah kits.",
  "We compared them on cost per nominal kilowatt-hour, the BMS current that each battery can pass, weight per battery, mounting shape and how the listing handles cold weather. They range from $539.99 to $1,559.96, and the price per kilowatt-hour runs from about $105 to $305. A bank of several batteries adds wiring, fuses and balancing considerations that a single battery does not, and each pick below spells those out."

The ECO-WORTHY comes in a reinforced metal case with built-in mounting feet, so it can be fixed directly without a battery box, and has a separate weak-current switch to disconnect output for wiring or storage. Its 250A battery management system, Bluetooth app and low-temperature charging protection are listed, and the title states 5,120Wh. The steel shell and internal cell brackets are described as resisting road vibration.\n\nIt ranks first because a single 400Ah removes the parallel wiring that every other pick here needs, and its 250A BMS supports about 3,200W at 12.8V. It costs $8 more than the HumsiENK four-pack and $135.70 more than the yeagulch two-pack, but each of those leaves you with several batteries to connect. It is $130 below the Redodo kit.\n\nPick it if you want one battery, one set of cables and a metal case for an RV. The caveat is that the listing gives no weight or dimensions, and one 400Ah battery is a single point of failure, so a fault takes the whole bank down.",

  {
    "criterion": "Single battery or parallel kit",
    "explanation": "A 400Ah bank is either one battery or several wired in parallel, and the two behave differently. A kit gives you more connections, more BMS units and a need to balance current, while a single battery has one failure point. Count the batteries in the title and bullets, and check that the total adds up to 400Ah."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Parallel wiring and current sharing",
    "explanation": "When batteries are in parallel, each takes a share of the load, but unequal cable length or resistance makes one work harder. A 100A BMS on each of four batteries can trip if one carries more than its share. Use equal-length cables of the same gauge, connect the load at opposite ends of the bank, and fuse each battery or the main lead as the maker recommends."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BMS amps converted to watts",
    "explanation": "A BMS rated 100A at 12.8V supports about 1,280 watts, 150A about 1,920, 200A about 2,560 and 250A about 3,200. A 3,000-watt inverter pulls roughly 250A, so a single 100A battery would shut down but two 200A batteries share it comfortably. Read the continuous rating and divide it by the number of batteries sharing the load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Usable energy at your discharge rate",
    "explanation": "5,120Wh is nominal, and you do not get all of it at high load or low cutoff voltage. At a heavy 2,000W load, inverter efficiency, wiring losses and the BMS cutoff reduce the energy you can use, so plan on perhaps 85 to 90 percent in practice. Check the cycle claim's depth of discharge and treat any claim at 60 percent as less demanding."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and mounting",
    "explanation": "Weight matters at 400Ah: four 100Ah batteries are about 79 pounds in total at 19.73 pounds each, two 200Ah batteries are about 101 to 118 pounds, and the single 400Ah battery's weight is not stated. Check the tray capacity, your tongue weight or axle limits, and whether the case suits strap-down mounting. A kit of small modules can spread weight across several bays."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold-weather charge cutoff",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells should not be charged below freezing, and some listings state it while others only say low-temperature protection. ECOBOSS gives 32°F with restart at 41°F, Paoweric allows charging from 0°C, and ECO-WORTHY says charging stops in freezing conditions. Pick a heated bay or ask the seller for the exact cutoff in writing."

  {
    "q": "Is one 400Ah battery better than four 100Ah batteries?",
    "a": "A single battery is simpler to wire and has one BMS, but it is one failure point and heavy. Four 100Ah batteries are lighter to carry and keep running if one fails, but they need a busbar, fuses and equal cable lengths."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire batteries in parallel for 400Ah?",
    "a": "Connect all positive terminals together and all negative terminals together with equal-length cables, then take the load from the positive of the first battery and the negative of the last. Fuse the main positive and use a busbar for four batteries."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do all the batteries need to be identical?",
    "a": "Yes. Use the same brand, model, capacity and age, and charge them together once before wiring. Paoweric states that expansion is limited to identical units, and mixing batteries can unbalance the bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 400Ah battery enough for an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "Check the running watts on your air conditioner label, then divide. As an example estimate, an assumed 1,500-watt running load drains 5,120 watt-hours in about 3.4 hours before inverter losses, and the startup surge is higher, so you need an inverter sized for it and ideally a soft-start device."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does 400Ah last?",
    "a": "Divide 5,120 watt-hours by your average load. A 100W load runs about 51 hours, and a 300W load about 17 hours before inverter losses. Add up your own appliances to get a realistic figure."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a separate monitor for a bank of batteries?",
    "a": "A shunt-based monitor on the main negative shows the whole bank, while each battery's Bluetooth app shows only that battery. For a kit of two or four batteries, a shunt is the better way to see overall state of charge."
