  "Searching for a 50 amp RV converter turns up a lot of products that only borrow the number. Many are 24V industrial supplies or small chargers that happen to say 50A somewhere in the listing. We kept only a real 120V AC to 12V DC power center sized for a 50 amp class rig. That leaves one pick, and the guide below explains what to verify before you buy any converter at this size, including battery chemistry, breaker space and your DC load."

    "description": "The Darella 8955-AD is a 50 amp RV power converter charger for lithium and lead-acid banks, priced at $139.69. It accepts 105 to 130 VAC at 60Hz, which matters at crowded campgrounds where shore voltage sags. A thermostatic fan only spins up when internal load and temperature rise, and it uses three-stage charging with chemistry auto-detect.\n\nIt is the only genuine 50 amp RV converter we found, so there is no sibling to compare it against on price here. Pick this if you are replacing a failed deck-mount or power-center converter and want lithium support without paying for a name-brand unit. The caveat is that no circuit breaker is pre-installed, so you must add your own breakers, and the listing gives no weight or warranty term.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "True 50A DC output",
    "explanation": "This is the continuous current the converter delivers to the 12V side, not the breaker size on the AC side. A 24V unit labeled 50A pushes half the charging power of a 12V one and cannot run RV loads at all. Check for 120V AC input and 12V DC output in the first bullet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lithium charge profile",
    "explanation": "Lithium banks want a bulk voltage near 14.2 to 14.6V and no long float. A lead-acid-only converter can undercharge lithium or hold it too high. Look for the words lithium or LiFePO4 plus a stage description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Input voltage tolerance",
    "explanation": "A converter that drops out below 105 VAC will shut off at weak parks and leave your batteries to carry the load. The Darella 8955-AD lists 105 to 130 VAC. Find the stated range, not just 120V."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Breaker and wiring needs",
    "explanation": "A bare unit without breakers means you must add a DC breaker sized to the wire and an AC feed. Skipping this risks overheating at 50A. Check the listing for pre-installed breakers and plan the parts cost."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cooling and noise",
    "explanation": "Fans that run constantly annoy anyone sleeping near the power center. A thermostatic fan only runs when heat builds. Look for temperature-triggered or load-triggered fan language."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 50 amp converter run on a 30 amp RV?",
    "a": "Yes, because the converter rating is DC output, not the shore plug. Your 30A pedestal still limits how much AC the whole rig can pull, so heavy charging plus an air conditioner can trip the breaker."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Darella 8955-AD safe for lithium batteries?",
    "a": "The listing says it supports lithium and lead-acid, but it does not publish the exact voltage stages. Confirm absorb and float values in the manual against your battery maker's limits before connecting."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why are some 50A converters 24V?",
    "a": "They are industrial or marine supplies that share the 50A label. They will not power a normal 12V RV system, so ignore them for a trailer or motorhome."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need to add a breaker?",
    "a": "With the Darella 8955-AD, yes, because no circuit breaker is pre-installed. Size the DC breaker to your wire gauge and the AC breaker to the converter's input draw."
