export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Two-leg monitoring",
    "explanation": "A 50 amp RV uses two 120 volt legs, and a fault on either leg can damage the coach. An EMS must monitor both legs and be rated 120V/240V, as the Progressive EMS-PT50X lists. Check the voltage rating on the listing, not only the amp number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Accidental 240V protection",
    "explanation": "A miswired pedestal can place 240 volts across a leg meant for 120, which can destroy appliances in seconds. An EMS with accidental 240V protection cuts power when that happens. Look for that phrase by name, because a surge-only unit does not provide it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage cutoffs and reset",
    "explanation": "Low voltage at crowded parks is a leading cause of air conditioner damage, so a 50 amp unit should disconnect under voltage and over voltage. Cutoffs are commonly near 104 volts on the low side and around 132 volts on the high side. Read the listing for over and under voltage protection or automatic shutoff and reset, and ask about restart delay if it is not stated."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joules versus protection",
    "explanation": "A big joule number, like 20,000 or 18,000, describes how much surge energy the unit can absorb. It does not mean the unit disconnects on a brownout. Treat joules as one factor, and check whether the listing also names cutoffs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Replaceable surge module",
    "explanation": "A big spike can use up the surge module while the rest of the unit works. The Power Watchdog units list a replaceable module, so you replace the part instead of the whole unit. Look for module wording on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Monitoring method",
    "explanation": "A display or app lets you diagnose a bad pedestal before you power the coach. The Power Watchdog PWD50W uses WiFi and Bluetooth, while the GEARGO 2026 Smart 50A uses an LED screen with voltage and frequency. Decide whether you want an app, a screen, or only indicator lights."
