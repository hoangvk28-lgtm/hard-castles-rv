  "At 50 amps the plug-in surge protector market splits into a price ladder, and the rungs are easy to climb without knowing what you are paying for. The cheapest units are a wiring analyzer with a surge component, the middle units add a relay that disconnects the coach at bad voltage, and the top rungs add displays, wattage readouts or brand name. Joule numbers jump around in all three tiers and do not follow price.",
  "We compared six plug-in 50 amp units from $44.99 to $109.99 as a value ladder: what does each rung add, what does the listing actually state, and where does paying more stop buying anything. Smart and app-driven EMS-style models and the classic hardwired motorhome picks are covered in sibling guides, so this one stays with straightforward plug-in protectors a first-time 50 amp owner can compare quickly."

It carries an IP67 cover, a fireproof ABS housing, and FCC, RoHS and UL cord testing.\n\nIt ranks first because it states its cutoff window, shows both legs separately and prints the fault guide on the unit, at $79.99.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Relay versus plain analyzer",
    "explanation": "A relay physically opens the circuit when voltage drops or rises outside a safe range, while a plain analyzer only absorbs spikes and lights a chart. Brownouts, not lightning, are the common cause of air conditioner damage at crowded parks. Read the listing for words like auto shutoff or disconnect and prefer a stated window."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Both legs of the service",
    "explanation": "A 50 amp service has two hot legs, L1 and L2, and a fault on one leg can run half your coach wrong while the other half looks fine. A display showing each leg or lights for missing L1 and L2 reveals this. Check that the listing names per-leg faults or shows two voltages."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Reset behavior after a trip",
    "explanation": "Automatic reconnect restores power when voltage returns, which keeps food cold but restarts compressors immediately. Manual reset waits for you, which is safer for the compressor but leaves the coach off while you are away. Check the reset wording and decide which suits how often you leave the rig."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Real wattage rating",
    "explanation": "A full 50 amp RV service carries about 12,000 watts across two 120 volt legs. A listing that gives 6,250 watts is quoting one 125 volt leg, which is easy to misread as lower capacity. Check that the unit is described as 50A for 120/240V service and that its plug matches the pedestal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Theft provision",
    "explanation": "A plug-in protector at a pedestal is visible and portable, so it is a common loss. A built-in ring for a chain or cable lock secures it in seconds. Check the listing for an anti-theft ring, and if none is listed, budget about ten dollars for a cable lock."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joule claims and certification",
    "explanation": "Joule claims here range from 4,200 to 30,000 and each seller uses its own method, so they are not comparable. Certification marks like UL and ETL address electrical safety, while FCC addresses radio interference. Use named certifications over bare joule counts when choosing."

  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with 50 amp protectors?",
    "a": "Buying on joules alone. A 30,000 joule plain analyzer will not disconnect your coach in a brownout, but a relay unit at 19,000 joules will. Look for a stated shutoff window first."

    "q": "Is the AMEHO worth $35.00 over the cheapest relay unit?",

    "q": "How do I plug in a protector correctly?",
    "a": "Turn off the pedestal breaker, plug the protector in, switch the breaker on and read the display before connecting your coach. Plug the coach cord into the protector only when the fault lights show correct wiring."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my protector keep tripping at one park?",
    "a": "Often the pedestal has low voltage under load, and relay units trip when voltage falls below about 104 volts. Reduce loads, try another site, or ask the office to check the pedestal."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do plug-in protectors need replacing after a storm?",
    "a": "If the unit absorbed a big surge, its internal parts may be spent even if the lights still work. Replace it after a close strike and test lights every trip."
