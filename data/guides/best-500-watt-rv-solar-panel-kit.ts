  "A 500 watt kit is easy to mislabel. Some listings sell a 500W panel as a pair of 250W units, some sell five 100W panels, and some sell a controller bundle that quietly covers only part of the array. Before comparing anything else, we required the included panels to add up to 500 watts, either five 100W panels or two 250W panels, and we set aside listings whose panel count we could not confirm.",
  "All six kits that passed are flexible-panel sets, priced from $249.99 to $599. That is a real constraint worth knowing: flexible panels bend to curved roofs and weigh far less than glass, but they usually run hotter and are glued down, so tilting them is impractical. The controller matters just as much, because a 500W array on a PWM controller delivers noticeably less than the same array on MPPT. The sections below show which kits fit which roof."

    "criterion": "Voltage and current data",
    "explanation": "You need open circuit voltage and short circuit current to match panels to a controller's limits. Only the Dual 250 50A lists them, at 23.5V and 15.6A per panel. Look for these numbers in the listing or datasheet, and check them against the controller's maximum input before wiring panels in parallel or series."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty and support",
    "explanation": "Flexible panels are a newer, more variable category, and a stated warranty is the best sign a seller stands behind them. None of these six kits states a warranty term in the feature text. Ask for the term in writing before you buy, and keep the order record."

    "q": "Can 500W of panels charge a 12V battery safely?",
    "a": "Yes, with a controller sized for the current. The AUECOOR MPPT 5x100 lists 40A MPPT, and the 50A controllers in the other kits suit a 500W array on 12V. Check that the controller supports your battery chemistry, including lithium."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake with 500W kits?",
    "a": "Assuming the kit delivers 500W. PWM controllers, heat on glued-down flexible panels and sun angle all cut output, and a realistic estimate is roughly 0.75 of rated watts times sun hours. Plan the battery and loads around that."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the AUECOOR MPPT 5x100 worth $180 more than the Bump ETFE 5x100?",
    "a": "If the roof is warm and you want maximum harvest, yes. MPPT can recover roughly a quarter of the output a PWM controller leaves unused, and you get an LCD readout. For lighter use, the PWM kit works at a lower price."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I wire five 100W panels?",
    "a": "Wire them in parallel for a 12V system, using Y or branch connectors, and keep the total current within the controller's rating. Fuse the battery side and use cable sized for about 27A or more. Check the controller manual for maximum input current."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain flexible panels?",
    "a": "Rinse with water and a soft cloth, avoid abrasive cleaners and check the edges for lifting after hot weather. Inspect grommets or adhesive twice a year and look for cracks or delamination in the surface."
