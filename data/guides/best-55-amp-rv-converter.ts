  "A 55 amp converter is the workhorse size for most travel trailers and fifth wheels with a single 30 amp shore cord. It has to run every 12V load in the rig, from the water pump and vent fans to the furnace blower, while still putting meaningful current back into the house battery. When one fails, the lights dim, the fridge board drops out, and the battery slowly drains even while you are plugged in.",
  "We compared six 55 amp units on what actually separates them: whether they hold full output when campground voltage sags, whether they charge lead-acid only or can switch to a 14.6V lithium profile, and whether they bolt into the same footprint as the WFCO WF-9800 deck-mount converter most RVs ship with. Prices run from about $62 to $249, and the cheapest unit is not automatically the wrong one."

    "description": "The WFCO WF-9855-AD-CB leads this roundup because it is the same deck-mount format that most travel trailers leave the factory with, so it drops into the existing bay without guesswork. Its patented Auto-Detect circuit reads whether you have lead-acid or LiFePO4 batteries and picks the right multi-stage profile on its own, and WFCO rates it for full output down to 100 volts of shore input.\n\nThat low-voltage rating is the real gap between it and the PowerMax PM4-55A ranked second. At a crowded park where the pedestal sags on a hot afternoon, a converter that throttles back leaves you charging slower than you expect, and WFCO specifically calls this out. It is also UL/CSA listed and FCC compliant, which none of the budget clones below document. You pay roughly $100 more than the PowerMax for that peace of mind.\n\nPick this if you want an OEM-grade replacement that handles a future lithium upgrade with no switch to remember. The caveat is that auto-detection can be confused by a battery that is deeply discharged or sitting behind a solar controller, so check its status light after install.",

It also carries current limiting, reverse-polarity, and thermal protection.\n\nCompared with the WFCO above, it skips auto-detection and the documented 100V low-input rating, which is why it sits second. In exchange it costs about $106 less and gives you hands-on control of the output, which some owners prefer once they have a battery with a specific charge voltage. It edges out the RecPro ranked just below on brand track record in the RV replacement market, though the two are close on price.\n\nThis suits a DIY owner comfortable reading a battery spec sheet and setting the converter to match.

Against the SUPLIFE below, the WAVLINK's lithium mode is the key difference, because the SUPLIFE is built only for lead-acid.\n\nChoose it if you want a cheap unit you can keep after moving to lithium.

What it adds is a 5-year warranty and an upgraded copper silent fan the seller rates about 30 percent quieter. It costs around $18 more than the KSGNY below, mainly for that longer published warranty and clearer WF-9800 fit list.\n\nBuy it if your rig runs lead-acid and you have no plan to change.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous 55 amp output",
    "explanation": "The amp rating is the total DC current the converter can supply to your 12V loads and battery combined. If the furnace blower, pump, and lights already draw 20 to 25 amps, only the remaining current goes into charging, so an undersized or derated unit charges painfully slowly. Confirm the listing states 55 amps continuous at around 950 watts rather than a peak figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging profile, not just voltage",
    "explanation": "A converter that only puts out a flat 13.6V is acting as a power supply, and it can take a day or more to refill a lead-acid battery. A true multi-stage charger raises voltage for bulk charging, then drops to float or storage so the battery is not cooked during weeks on shore power. Look for named stages such as bulk, absorption, and float in the bullet points, not just one output voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lithium compatibility you can verify",
    "explanation": "A 12V LiFePO4 battery wants roughly 14.2 to 14.6V to fill and no constant high float, which a lead-acid profile does not provide. Running lithium on a lead-only converter usually leaves the bank undercharged rather than dangerous, but you lose much of the capacity you paid for. Check for a stated lithium mode or Auto-Detect and the exact lithium voltage, which should be 14.6V or a little below."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low input voltage tolerance",
    "explanation": "Campground pedestals often sag toward 105V or lower on hot days when every rig runs air conditioning. Some converters cut output when input drops, which slows charging exactly when you need it. Look for a published minimum input voltage at full output; only the WFCO here documents full power down to 100V."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Physical fit and mounting style",
    "explanation": "Most trailers use a deck-mount WF-9800 series unit, often under the fridge or near the panel. A replacement that matches the footprint reuses the screws and DC lugs, while a mismatched unit means new holes and cable runs. Measure your existing converter and compare it to the listed dimensions and model compatibility before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fan noise and certification",
    "explanation": "The converter often sits under a bed or dinette, so a fan that runs constantly can keep light sleepers awake. Temperature or load controlled fans stay quiet at low draw, and UL or CSA listing shows the unit passed third-party safety review. Look for a variable-speed fan description and an explicit listing mark rather than vague quality claims."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Will a 55 amp converter fit where my WF-9855 was?",
    "a": "Most WF-9800 series replacements are designed to match the WF-9855 deck-mount footprint and wiring. The WFCO WF-9855-AD-CB is the genuine part, and the SUPLIFE and KSGNY units list WF-9800 series fit. Measure the old unit before ordering a standalone like the PowerMax, which may need new mounting holes."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake when replacing a converter?",
    "a": "Buying a lead-acid only unit and then installing lithium batteries. The battery will usually stay undercharged at around 13.6V, so you lose usable capacity and the state-of-charge readings look wrong. If lithium is anywhere in your plans, pick a unit with a lithium mode or Auto-Detect."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the WFCO worth it over a $60 clone?",
    "a": "For many owners yes, because it documents full output down to 100V input, carries UL/CSA listing, and switches lithium profiles automatically. If you camp only at stable full-hookup sites with lead-acid batteries, a clone such as the SUPLIFE does the core job for far less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a replacement converter safely?",
    "a": "Unplug shore power, turn off any inverter, and disconnect the battery negative before touching the converter. Photograph the wiring, move each DC lead to the same terminal on the new unit, and torque the lugs firmly. Reconnect the battery first, then shore power, and confirm voltage at the battery rises."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 55 amps enough for my RV?",
    "a": "A 55 amp unit suits most single-axle and tandem trailers with one or two batteries on a 30 amp service. If you have a large lithium bank and want fast recharge from a generator, a 60 to 100 amp converter cuts charge time noticeably."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my converter fan run all the time?",
    "a": "A fan that never stops usually means the unit is working near its limit or sits in a hot, poorly vented space. Check that the vents are clear and that loads are not near 55 amps. Units like the WAVLINK only start the fan when temperature rises, so constant running is a sign to investigate."
