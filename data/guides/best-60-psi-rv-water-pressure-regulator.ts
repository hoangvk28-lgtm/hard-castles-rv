export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Why 60 psi is the edge",
    "explanation": "Many RV systems are rated near 60 psi. It matters because 60 psi leaves little margin for pressure spikes. Check your maker's limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hose-end vs in-line",
    "explanation": "A hose-end regulator goes at the spigot, while an in-line valve goes on the RV pipe. It matters for protection coverage. Choose based on where you want protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fixed vs adjustable",
    "explanation": "A fixed unit is simple, and an adjustable one lets you tune. It matters for fine control. Look for a gauge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thread and pipe size",
    "explanation": "3/4 inch garden hose thread and 1/2 inch NPT are different. It matters for fit. Match the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Measure under flow",
    "explanation": "Static pressure differs from running pressure. It matters for tuning. Use a gauge while water is running."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is 60 psi safe for RV plumbing?",
    "a": "Some RV plumbing is rated near 60 psi, so it leaves a small margin. Check the maker's limit and prefer 50 to 55 psi if unsure."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do people make?",
    "a": "Buying RO filter regulators with quick connect ports. Those are for filter tubing, not RV hoses."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the AOLINK Adjustable worth it over the Camco Flow Stainless?",
    "a": "If you want to read and tune pressure, yes. For a simple fixed unit, the Camco costs about the same."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a hose regulator?",
    "a": "Screw it onto the spigot with the water off, attach the hose and then open the valve slowly. Check every joint for leaks with the water on."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain it?",
    "a": "Drain it before freezing weather so trapped water does not crack the body. Replace it if pressure drifts or if it starts to leak."
