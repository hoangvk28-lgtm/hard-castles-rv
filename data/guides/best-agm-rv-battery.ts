We evaluated rated capacity, physical group size, published temperature ranges, warranty length, and buyer feedback, keeping in mind that you should only use about half of an AGM's rated amp-hours if you want it to last."

Renogy publishes a full capacity table, from 152.9Ah at the 3-hour rate up to 200Ah at the 20-hour rate, and quotes monthly self-discharge below 3% at 77F.\n\nIt ranks above the Interstate group 31 because it doubles the energy in one battery for roughly the same price as a single premium 100Ah unit, which makes it the best value per amp-hour among our sealed house batteries. The tradeoff is physical: it is far larger and heavier than a group 31, so it will not fit a typical tongue box.\n\nBest for Class A and fifth-wheel owners with a basement battery bay who want maximum sealed capacity.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Plan for 50% Usable Capacity",
    "explanation": "AGM batteries are lead acid, and regularly draining them below about half charge sharply shortens their life. A 100Ah AGM therefore delivers about 50Ah in daily use, while a 200Ah gives about 100Ah. When comparing listings, halve the rated amp-hours to estimate how long your loads will really run."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match the Group Size",
    "explanation": "BCI group size describes the case footprint, and RV trays are usually sized for group 24, 27, or 31. A battery that is even half an inch too long will not fit under the hold-down strap. Check the listed length, width, and height against your tray before buying, and do not assume all 100Ah batteries are the same size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Deep Cycle vs Dual Purpose Plates",
    "explanation": "Dual purpose batteries list CCA and MCA because they are built to start engines as well as cycle. Pure deep cycle batteries usually skip those ratings and focus on cycle life. If the battery will only power your trailer, prioritize a published cycle count or reserve capacity over CCA."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging Voltage and Converter Settings",
    "explanation": "AGM batteries generally want an absorption charge around 14.4V; many older RV converters stop near 13.6V and never fully charge them. Chronic undercharging slowly sulfates the plates and reduces capacity. Look for a recommended charge voltage in the listing and compare it with your converter's spec, or plan to upgrade to a converter with an AGM setting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold Weather Ratings",
    "explanation": "Unlike lithium, AGM can usually be charged below freezing, which is a real advantage for winter campers. Ranges vary, though, so a battery rated to charge at 14F is better suited to frosty nights than one with no published range. Look for separate charge and discharge temperature ranges in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and Installation",
    "explanation": "A 100Ah AGM typically weighs around 60 to 70 pounds, and a 200Ah can be much heavier. That weight counts against your trailer's tongue weight and makes installation harder. Check the listed weight and consider two smaller batteries if lifting one large one is not practical."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use an AGM battery with my stock RV converter?",
    "a": "Usually yes, since AGM is lead acid and most converters charge it adequately. However, many older converters charge at a lower voltage than AGM prefers, so the battery may never reach full charge. If your converter has a selectable profile, set it to AGM; if not, consider a converter upgrade."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake shortens AGM battery life the most?",
    "a": "Repeatedly running it nearly flat. Discharging below about 50% regularly, or leaving it discharged for days, causes sulfation that permanently reduces capacity. Recharge promptly after each trip and use a battery monitor to watch state of charge."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is AGM worth it over flooded lead acid?",
    "a": "For most RVers, yes, if you value no maintenance and no venting. AGM costs more per amp-hour but needs no watering and can be mounted in enclosed spaces. Flooded batteries remain cheaper and tolerant, but only if you will check water levels regularly."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect two AGM batteries in parallel?",
    "a": "Connect positive to positive and negative to negative using equal length heavy gauge cables. Take the RV's main positive from one battery and the main negative from the other, so both share the load evenly. Always use two identical batteries of the same age, like the Renogy two-pack."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is AGM or lithium better for an RV?",
    "a": "Lithium offers far more usable capacity, lighter weight, and longer life, but costs more and needs heating or protection to charge below freezing. AGM is cheaper upfront, works with almost any converter, and handles cold charging better. If you camp mostly at hookups or in winter, AGM still makes sense."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store an AGM battery over winter?",
    "a": "Charge it fully, disconnect it or switch off the battery disconnect, and keep it somewhere it will not get extremely hot. With low self-discharge, a quality AGM can sit for months, but topping it up every two to three months, or using a maintainer, keeps it healthy."
