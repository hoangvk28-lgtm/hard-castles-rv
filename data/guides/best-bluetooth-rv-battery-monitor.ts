  "The voltage gauge on most RV panels is a poor fuel gauge, especially with lithium. A LiFePO4 battery holds a nearly flat voltage from about 90 percent down to 20 percent, so a reading of 13.2V tells you almost nothing about how many hours of furnace or fridge time you have left. A shunt-based monitor counts every amp going in and out and turns that into a real state of charge.",
  "Every pick here uses a shunt and sends data to a phone app over Bluetooth. We compared the shunt current rating, the voltage range, what the app actually shows, how alarms work, and whether the monitor can share data with chargers or a remote system. Prices for Victron vary widely by seller, so those listings show check current price."

It reports state of charge, time remaining, voltage, current, amp hours, charge cycles, deepest discharge, and voltage highs and lows in the VictronConnect app, and works from 6.5 to 70V.\n\nWhat puts it above the BMV-712 ranked second is price and simplicity: it skips the wired display and does everything through the phone. Over the REDARC and LiTime units below, its advantage is VE.Smart Networking, which shares live battery data with Victron solar chargers so they charge more precisely. An aux input can monitor a second battery, a midpoint, or an optional temperature sensor.\n\nThis is the pick for most RV owners, particularly anyone with or planning Victron gear. The caveat: with no screen, you need your phone to see anything, and the 500A shunt may be undersized for a large inverter.",

It shows state of charge, voltage, current, and energy or time remaining on a wall-mounted screen, adds Bluetooth for the VictronConnect app, and works from 6.5 to 70V DC.\n\nIt ranks second only because the display costs more and requires a cable run from the shunt. In exchange, it adds a programmable relay that can control other devices, such as starting a generator at a low state of charge, a feature none of the cheaper picks below offer. Its extra input can measure battery temperature, a midpoint, or a second battery.\n\nChoose it if you want a glanceable readout by the door and relay control.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Shunt-based measurement",
    "explanation": "A shunt is a precision resistor on the battery negative that measures every amp flowing in or out. Counting those amps over time gives a true state of charge, which voltage alone cannot do with flat-curve lithium. Confirm the product includes a shunt rather than a clamp or voltage-only sensor."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shunt current rating",
    "explanation": "The shunt rating must exceed your highest continuous current. A 2000W inverter can pull over 160 amps at 12V, and a 3000W unit well over 250, so a 300A shunt can be stretched. Add up your largest loads and pick a rating with margin, shown in the product title as 300A, 400A, or 500A."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Everything through the shunt",
    "explanation": "The monitor only sees current passing through it, so every load and charger negative must connect to the system side of the shunt, with only the battery on the other side. A single ground wire bypassing it makes the SOC drift. Check your wiring plan before buying and note that installation guides from these brands stress this point."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity setup and sync",
    "explanation": "The monitor needs your bank's real amp-hour capacity and syncs to 100 percent when it sees a full charge. Entering the wrong capacity or never fully charging causes SOC errors that grow over days. Look for app settings for capacity and charged voltage, and plan a full charge occasionally."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Alarms and history",
    "explanation": "A low state of charge alarm warns you before the BMS shuts off the battery, and history shows parasitic draws you did not know about. Budget models vary widely in this area. Read the listing for named alarms and how many days of history are stored."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bluetooth range and integration",
    "explanation": "Bluetooth often works through a trailer wall but struggles through metal compartments. Some monitors also share data with chargers or remote gateways, improving charging accuracy. Check the stated range and whether the app ties into gear you already own."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Will a shunt monitor work with my lithium battery's own Bluetooth?",
    "a": "Yes, they can run together. The battery's BMS app reports its own estimate, while a shunt like the Victron SmartShunt measures the whole system, which helps with multiple batteries."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common installation mistake?",
    "a": "Leaving a ground wire connected directly to the battery negative, bypassing the shunt. Every load and charger must connect on the system side, or the state of charge will be wrong."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Victron SmartShunt worth it over the ANCEL BM1000?",
    "a": "If you use Victron chargers or want aux inputs and higher shunt capacity, yes. If you only need a reliable fuel gauge, the ANCEL does the core job for much less."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up the monitor after installation?",
    "a": "Enter your bank capacity in amp-hours, set the charged voltage and tail current to suit your battery chemistry, then fully charge the bank so the monitor syncs to 100 percent."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my state of charge drift over time?",
    "a": "Drift usually comes from incorrect capacity settings, a bypassed ground, or rarely reaching full charge. Fix wiring, correct settings, and charge fully to resync."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a battery monitor drain my battery?",
    "a": "Shunt monitors draw a very small current, but a rig left in storage for months should still be disconnected or kept on a maintainer to avoid slow drain."
