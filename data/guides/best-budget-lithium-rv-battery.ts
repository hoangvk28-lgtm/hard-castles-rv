  "Not every RV needs a $500 battery bank. A teardrop with LED lights and a fan, a pop-up that mostly stays on hookups, or a truck camper that only needs to run a water pump overnight can get every lithium benefit, light weight and full usable capacity, from a battery that costs less than $180.",
  "This guide stays under that line. We compared six budget LiFePO4 batteries from 30Ah to 100Ah on usable capacity, weight, BMS limits, and warranty, based on published specs and buyer feedback, and we note which ones make sense as a main house battery and which are better as a small second battery."

The POERUNI wins because the price difference is meaningful at this budget, and most small rigs never pull more than a few dozen amps.\n\nBest for teardrop, pop-up, and small travel trailer owners who want to replace one lead-acid battery as cheaply as possible.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Usable Capacity for Your Loads",
    "explanation": "Capacity in Ah tells you how much energy the battery stores, and LiFePO4 lets you use nearly all of it. A 50Ah lithium battery delivers roughly what a 100Ah lead-acid does when lead-acid is kept above half charge. Add up your overnight loads in amp hours and pick a battery with some margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cost per Ah, Not Just Price",
    "explanation": "At the budget end, small batteries often cost more per Ah than a 100Ah unit. A $118 50Ah battery is about $2.36 per Ah, while a $128 100Ah battery is about $1.28. Do the division before assuming the cheapest listing is the best deal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger Compatibility",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 wants a charger that holds around 14.4V to 14.6V and does not equalize or desulfate. Some budget listings warn that automatic lead-acid chargers may not fully charge the battery, which leaves you with less capacity than you paid for. Check your converter or charger for a lithium mode."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length",
    "explanation": "Budget lithium warranties range from 12 months to five years, a bigger spread than any spec difference. A longer warranty on a cheap battery is a strong signal the seller expects it to last. Read the warranty line in the bullets before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold-Weather Charging Limits",
    "explanation": "No battery on this list is heated, so none should be charged below freezing. Some publish an exact charge cutoff, such as 19.4°F, while others only give an operating range. If you camp in spring or fall, look for a stated cutoff and plan to charge after the battery warms."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a 50Ah lithium battery enough for a pop-up camper?",
    "a": "For lights, a fan, and phone charging, often yes for one night. Running a furnace fan or water pump heavily will drain it faster, so a 100Ah battery like the POERUNI is safer for longer stays."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the CHITOLI 100Ah worth it over the POERUNI 100Ah?",
    "a": "If you have a Group 24 tray or plan to run a small inverter, yes. You get a published 100A BMS, a true Group 24 size, and a five-year warranty for about $25 more."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use my old lead-acid charger with a budget lithium battery?",
    "a": "It may charge it partially, but many lead-acid chargers stop short of a full lithium charge or apply desulfation modes that are not suitable. A LiFePO4-compatible charger is the reliable choice."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with cheap lithium batteries?",
    "a": "Buying too small. Many owners pick a 30Ah or 50Ah battery to save money, then find it will not last the night, when a 100Ah battery cost only a little more and lowered the cost per Ah."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I keep a budget lithium battery healthy in storage?",
    "a": "Store it partially charged, disconnect it from the RV so small draws do not drain it, and keep it out of freezing temperatures if you plan to charge it. Check it every few months."
