  "A cheap battery monitor only helps if it measures current through a shunt, because voltage alone misreads state of charge on lithium. The five here cost $18.59 to $59.99, and they differ in shunt rating (100A to 500A), screen type and alarms. Pick by the biggest load you run, not the price, since an undersized shunt reads wrong or overheats."
