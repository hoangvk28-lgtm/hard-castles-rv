export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "What catalytic means",
    "explanation": "A catalytic burner oxidizes propane across a heated pad instead of using an open flame, giving gentler radiant heat and fewer emissions. It still consumes oxygen. Look for the word catalytic in the product name or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BTU and room size",
    "explanation": "BTU measures heat output per hour. About 6,000 BTU is a typical figure for 200 square feet, and an 8,000 plus unit suits larger spaces. Match the stated coverage to your trailer length."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ignition style",
    "explanation": "Piezo lighters need no power, while battery pulse ignition needs AAA cells you must carry. The Hotdevil uses pulse ignition with two AAA batteries. Check which type each listing names."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel connection",
    "explanation": "Small 1 lb cylinders are convenient but run dry fast. A hose to a larger tank gives longer runtime. See which fuel options the listing allows."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ventilation needs",
    "explanation": "All propane heaters consume oxygen and create moisture. Crack a vent and keep a carbon monoxide alarm working. Look for oxygen or safety shut-off features on the product page."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I run a catalytic heater while sleeping?",
    "a": "Only if it has an oxygen or shut-off safeguard, you vent the RV and a working carbon monoxide alarm is present."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a catalytic heater better than a radiant one?",
    "a": "Catalytic units burn more cleanly and quietly, but they still need ventilation and cost more."
  },
  {
    "q": "What fuel do these use?",
    "a": "Propane. Both the Hotdevil and the Blazeal run on 1 lb cylinders, which are sold separately."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store it?",
    "a": "Let it cool, disconnect the cylinder and keep the burner pad dry and clean."
