  "Compact lithium means a battery one person can lift and fit under a seat, and it also means smaller current limits. The three 12V LiFePO4 batteries here weigh about 5 pounds, hold roughly 256 to 282 watt-hours and carry a 20A to 30A BMS. That is plenty for lights, a fan and a phone, but not for an inverter. Check the BMS rating against your loads before buying."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours, not amp-hours",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours equal volts times amp-hours, so a 12.8V 20Ah battery holds 256Wh. Comparing Ah between voltages misleads. Multiply the listed volts by Ah yourself."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BMS continuous current",
    "explanation": "The battery management system cuts power above its rated amps. A 20A BMS limits you near 240W at 12V and may trip on pump startup. Find the amp number in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold weather charging cutoff limits",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells can be damaged by charging below freezing, and many small batteries have no heater. A winter trip with a solar charger can then silently push current into cold cells. Look for a low-temperature charge cutoff or heater stated in the listing, and keep the battery inside the heated space below 32F."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Terminal size and wiring",
    "explanation": "M5 terminals suit thin wire and small lugs, not thick inverter cables. Oversized cable on small terminals overheats. Check the terminal type in the specs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and exact dimensions",
    "explanation": "Compact only helps if the case fits your compartment. A 5.5 pound battery is easy to lift but must clear your space. Compare the inch dimensions with a tape measure."
