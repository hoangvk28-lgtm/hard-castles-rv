  "Compact in an RV inverter means small enough to mount in a tight bay and sized for what you really run. The three picks here range from 300W to 1000W, and all are pure sine wave, which matters for laptop chargers and CPAP machines. The tradeoff is simple: more watts and a transfer switch cost money and space, while a 300W plug-in unit is cheap but limited."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous vs peak watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are what the inverter holds for hours; peak covers startup. A 300W unit cannot run a 700W microwave. Look for the continuous rating in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine wave output",
    "explanation": "Pure sine matches household power and protects sensitive electronics. Modified sine can buzz or damage chargers. Check that the listing says pure sine."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Input voltage range",
    "explanation": "The input range tells you whether it tolerates charging voltage. The BESTEK B08L919L4X lists 11 to 17V. Match it to your battery system."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuse and protections",
    "explanation": "A built-in fuse and shutdowns prevent fires. The BESTEK lists a 40 amp fuse. Look for overheat, short circuit and polarity protection."
