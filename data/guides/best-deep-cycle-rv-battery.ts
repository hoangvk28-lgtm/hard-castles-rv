  "A deep cycle battery is the one that runs your RV when it is not plugged in: lights, water pump, furnace fan, and the fridge control board. Unlike the starting battery in your tow vehicle, it is built to be drained and recharged over and over, and choosing between lithium and AGM is now the biggest decision in this category.",
  "We compared group 24 and group 27 deep cycle batteries from Power Queen, Renogy, CYCLENBATT, Mighty Max, RVLithTime, and Marxon, mixing LiFePO4 and AGM so you can see the real tradeoffs side by side. Our evaluation looked at usable energy rather than just rated amp-hours, low-temperature charging protection, published cycle life, weight, and warranty terms, along with buyer feedback."

Built-in Bluetooth 5.0 lets you check state of charge, voltage, current, and temperature from your phone.\n\nIt ranks first because it gives the most usable energy per tray slot in this roundup: lithium can be drained much deeper than the Renogy AGM, so this one battery delivers more than double the AGM's practical capacity. Against the CYCLENBATT below, you pay more but get 25Ah extra and app monitoring.\n\nBest for travel trailer and fifth-wheel owners upgrading from lead acid who want one drop-in battery.

Compared with the Power Queen above, though, it offers far less usable energy and weighs much more, which is the real cost of choosing lead acid.\n\nBest for owners who camp in freezing weather or do not want to upgrade their charging system.

It comes with a five-year warranty.\n\nIt ranks third because it brings the essential lithium safety feature for RVs, cold-charge protection, at a lower price than the Power Queen. The tradeoff is 25Ah less capacity and no app, so you need a separate battery monitor to see state of charge accurately.\n\nBest for budget-conscious owners making their first lithium switch who camp in shoulder seasons.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Usable Capacity by Chemistry",
    "explanation": "Rated amp-hours describe total storage, but you can only use part of it without harming the battery. LiFePO4 handles 80 to 100% depth of discharge, while lead acid like AGM should stay above about 50%. Compare usable amp-hours, not the label number, so a 100Ah lithium roughly equals a 200Ah AGM in practice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low-Temperature Charge Protection",
    "explanation": "Charging LiFePO4 below 32F can plate lithium on the cells and permanently reduce capacity. A BMS with a low-temperature cutoff blocks charging until the battery warms up. Look for an explicit statement like charging stops below 32F in the listing; if it is missing, assume the battery has no protection."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger and Converter Compatibility",
    "explanation": "Lithium wants a charge around 14.4 to 14.6V and no long float, while many older RV converters are tuned for lead acid. A mismatch can leave lithium undercharged or keep it held at a high float. Check your converter label for a lithium mode, and look for recommended charge settings in the battery listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BMS Current Rating",
    "explanation": "The BMS limits how much current the battery can supply, which caps the size of inverter you can run. A 100A BMS supports roughly 1000 to 1200W at 12V, while bigger loads like a microwave or air conditioner need more. Find the BMS amp rating in the specs and compare it with your largest AC load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Group Size and Weight",
    "explanation": "RV trays are usually group 24 or 27, and lithium often fits more capacity into the same space. Weight matters too: a group 27 AGM can weigh around 60 pounds versus about 22 to 30 pounds for lithium. Check listed dimensions against your box and factor weight into tongue load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Starting vs House Duty",
    "explanation": "Deep cycle lithium batteries are energy storage only and are not designed to start engines. Dual purpose AGM batteries list CCA or MCA ratings and can do both. If the battery must also crank an engine, choose a model with a cranking rating; otherwise a pure deep cycle battery will last longer."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I drop a lithium deep cycle battery into my RV's old battery box?",
    "a": "Usually, if the dimensions fit, since group 24 and 27 lithium batteries match lead acid footprints. Check that your converter, solar controller, and any alternator charging can handle lithium settings. Some older converters will work but never fully charge the battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake when buying a deep cycle RV battery?",
    "a": "Comparing rated amp-hours across chemistries. A 100Ah AGM gives about 50Ah of daily usable energy, while a 100Ah lithium gives most of its rating. Buyers often under-size lead acid banks or overpay for capacity they do not need."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is lithium worth it over AGM for an RV?",
    "a": "If you camp off grid regularly, usually yes, because lithium lasts thousands of cycles, weighs far less, and delivers about twice the usable energy per rated amp-hour. If you mostly use hookups or camp in freezing weather without heated batteries, AGM's lower price and cold charging can make more sense."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a new deep cycle battery in my RV?",
    "a": "Turn off the battery disconnect and unplug shore power. Disconnect the negative cable first, then the positive, swap the battery, and reconnect positive first and negative last. Tighten terminals firmly, secure the hold-down, and set your charger to the correct battery profile."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I mix lithium and AGM batteries in one bank?",
    "a": "No. They have different charge voltages and discharge curves, so one will overwork while the other is undercharged. Replace the whole bank with one chemistry, ideally identical batteries of the same age."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a deep cycle RV battery between trips?",
    "a": "Charge AGM fully and keep it topped up every couple of months. Store lithium at around 50 to 70% charge with the battery disconnected, since BMS electronics can slowly drain it. Keep lithium above freezing if you plan to charge it during storage."
