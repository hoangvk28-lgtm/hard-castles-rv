This guide covers the one genuine diesel pick here, explains what the listing leaves out, and tells you when a gas or dual-fuel inverter is the smarter buy."

Total harmonic distortion is 6%, and it has a steel cradle and lifting eye. It costs $4,249.\n\nThere is no sibling here, and the nearest alternative is a gas inverter at a fraction of the price. Pick this if you want long unattended runtime and diesel fuel. The caveat: the listing gives no weight, noise or RV outlet details, and 6% THD is higher than inverters.",

export const buyingCriteria = [

  {
    "criterion": "Runtime at load",
    "explanation": "Runtime depends on load, and 32.4 hours is quoted at 50% load. At full load it is shorter. Check the load percentage behind any runtime claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise rating",
    "explanation": "Diesels are loud, and many campgrounds limit generator hours or noise. Without a dBA figure you cannot compare. Check for a rating at a stated distance."
