  },
  {
    "q": "Does buying duracell guarantee the same battery chemistry across every model?",
    "a": "No. A brand's lineup can span different battery chemistries and generations, so verify the exact model's documented chemistry and cycle-life rather than assuming brand consistency."
  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?",
    "a": "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does a surge or peak wattage rating mean the station can run appliances at that power level?",
    "a": "No. Surge or peak ratings describe a brief burst the inverter can handle, typically for a compressor or motor startup, not a sustained output level. Always check the continuous or rated wattage figure for what the station can actually run for extended periods."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety."
