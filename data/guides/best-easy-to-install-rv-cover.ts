These two picks are both built around getting the strap system under and over the rig with one person, using toss bags, labeled panels and elastic hems. We compared fabric, strap layout and access doors, and kept only complete covers that match the title."

Double-stitched top, edges and corners carry an 800 lb rip-stop rating, and a 3500mm waterproof PU coating sits underneath.\n\nAgainst the Lanceton, the heavier Oxford top gives it a sturdier feel when you drag it across a roofline, and the rollable zippered doors on the side and rear let you reach the entry door and engine area without unstrapping anything.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Measured length and body style",
    "explanation": "A cover is cut for a stated length range and a body style, such as Class C or travel trailer. A cover that is too small strains seams and straps, while one that is too large flaps and chafes. Measure bumper to bumper plus ladder and hitch, then match that to the listed range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Toss bag or strap guide",
    "explanation": "A weighted toss bag or belt lets you throw a strap across the roof and pull it under the rig instead of crawling beneath. This cuts the time of the hardest step and makes solo installs realistic. Look for the feature named in the listing, not a vague claim of easy setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Front and rear tension panels",
    "explanation": "Elastic or adjustable panels at the ends pull the fabric tight so wind cannot get underneath. A loose end is where most covers start to flog and wear. Check the listing for elastic hems or adjustable panels at both ends."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Access zippers",
    "explanation": "Rollable zip doors let you reach the entry door, storage or engine area without removing the cover. They also help you check the interior between trips. Count the doors and note which sides they sit on."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fabric layers and denier",
    "explanation": "Denier and layer count describe how heavy the fabric is, and heavier fabric holds up to dragging and wind. A thicker top matters most because it takes the sun and rain. Compare the top and side fabric separately, since many covers use a lighter side."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How long should a cover install take?",
    "a": "With a toss-bag system and a second person, many owners finish in well under an hour. Alone, plan extra time for the first install until you learn where each strap runs."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need to remove the cover to enter my RV?",
    "a": "Not with zippered access doors. The KING BIRD Class C has rollable doors on the side and rear for the entry door and engine area."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I buy a Class C cover for a trailer?",
    "a": "No. Body style changes the cut, so match the cover type to your rig. The Lanceton Trailer is made for towables."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I still need tire covers?",
    "a": "Tire covers keep sun off sidewalls during storage. The Lanceton Trailer includes four, while the KING BIRD Class C is sold as the cover alone."
