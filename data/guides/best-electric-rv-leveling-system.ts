The complete kits in this category are few and expensive, so the question is whether the convenience is worth it.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Complete kit versus parts",
    "explanation": "A leveling system includes jacks, controller and wiring, while a motor or single jack is a repair part. Check the listing says system or kit. Replacement parts cost far less but will not level a trailer on their own."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Number of points",
    "explanation": "A 5-point system uses four corner jacks plus a tongue jack. More points give steadier support. Count the jacks listed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tow vehicle and trailer type",
    "explanation": "Systems are built for travel trailers or fifth wheels, not both. Confirm the type in the title. A kit made for the wrong hitch type will not bolt up, so this is the first spec to check."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Control options",
    "explanation": "A wall touchpad is basic, while app control adds convenience. Look for the control method on the product page. Remote or app control is handy when you want to level from outside the trailer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Install and power",
    "explanation": "Electric jacks draw 12V power and need wiring. Check the hardware list and your battery capacity. Plan for a battery that can supply a steady draw while the jacks run."

  {
    "q": "Can I install it myself?",
    "a": "The kit is bolt-on with hardware, but it needs wiring and mechanical comfort."

    "q": "Is it worth the cost?",
    "a": "For frequent travelers, yes. Occasional campers can use blocks."
  },
