export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "How external sensors work",
    "explanation": "An external sensor screws onto the valve stem in place of the cap, so installation takes minutes and needs no tire dismounting. To add air the sensor must be removed, which is the main inconvenience compared with flow-through designs. Check that the listing says external, since several kits do not state the type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight on the valve stem",
    "explanation": "A sensor hanging on the stem adds weight and leverage, and rubber stems can flex or wear over time. Metal stems or stem supports hold up better on rough roads. Check your stem type before choosing screw-on sensors."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Theft exposure",
    "explanation": "Screw-on sensors can be unscrewed by someone passing a parked rig. Anti-theft locking nuts make removal harder. Look for a locking nut or tamper-proof design in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Psi ceiling",
    "explanation": "Tymate TM2 states 87 psi and B-Qtech states 116 psi, while heavier RV tires may run well above that. A ceiling below your tire's maximum cold pressure makes the sensor useless. Compare the stated range with the pressure on the tire sidewall."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wheel count and display",
    "explanation": "A four-sensor kit covers one tandem axle, while a six-sensor kit covers a three-axle rig or a dual-rear motorhome. Some displays cycle through more tires than the kit includes. Count every tire you want on one screen."
