  "Running a 50 amp RV from a portable generator takes more than a 50A sticker. You need an outlet that matches your RV plug, and enough running watts that two air conditioners do not trip the unit. Of the candidates we reviewed, three listings state a 50 amp socket and a size that makes sense for a big rig. Their listings do not name the receptacle model, so confirm 14-50R or L14-50R before you buy."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Receptacle type",
    "explanation": "A 50A RV cord uses a 14-50 plug, and a locking L14-50 version exists on some generators. A mismatch forces an adapter that can limit power. Check the manual for 14-50R or L14-50R by name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Running vs starting watts",
    "explanation": "Running watts are what the generator holds for hours, starting watts only last seconds. A 13.5k air conditioner needs about 3,000 running watts and a big surge to start. Compare the running figure for your fuel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel-specific output",
    "explanation": "Propane usually cuts output by about 10 percent. The GENMAX 7250W drops from 6,000 to 5,500W. Look for ratings listed separately for gas and propane."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise at distance",
    "explanation": "Decibel ratings only mean something with a distance and load. 60 dBA at 23 feet and 25% load is quieter than the same number at 7 feet. Look for the test distance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Neutral bonding and safety",
