export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Check When the Heater Starts",
    "explanation": "Self-heating batteries warm their cells before allowing charge. Some start heating below 41F, others only at 32F, and the earlier start gives more margin. Look for the exact start and stop temperatures in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Know What Powers the Heater",
    "explanation": "Most heaters run only when a charger is connected, using incoming current, not the battery itself. Some also need a minimum current, like more than 10A, to switch on. Check this if you rely on modest winter solar."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Understand Discharge Limits",
    "explanation": "Heating fixes charging in the cold, but the BMS may still cut discharge at very low temperatures such as -4F. If the battery shuts down, your furnace fan stops. Read the discharge range and consider an insulated compartment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match BMS to Winter Loads",
    "explanation": "Furnace fans draw only a few amps, but inverters for heaters or coffee makers draw much more. A 100A BMS suits about 1000W; 200A to 300A supports larger loads. Check the continuous rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm Physical Fit",
    "explanation": "Heated 100Ah batteries come in Group 24 and Group 31 sizes, while 300Ah and larger need a bigger bay. Measure before buying. Compare the listed dimensions to your tray."
  },

    "criterion": "Do Not Mix Heated and Unheated Units",

  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a heated lithium battery if my RV has a heated basement?",
    "a": "Not always. If the battery bay stays above 32F, a standard LiFePO4 works, but a heated battery adds protection if the furnace fails or you dry camp."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake with heated lithium batteries?",
    "a": "Assuming the heater runs on its own. Most heaters only work while a charger supplies current, so a battery sitting cold with no charge input will not warm itself."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a heated battery worth it over a regular one plus a heating pad?",
    "a": "Usually yes, because the built-in heater is controlled by the BMS and only charges once the cells are warm. Add-on pads need their own controller and wiring."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up charging for a heated battery?",
    "a": "Use a lithium charge profile, usually 14.4 to 14.6V, and make sure your charger supplies enough current to trigger the heater, which some models need above 10A."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a heated battery still shut off in extreme cold?",
    "a": "Yes. Several BMS units stop discharge near -4F. In very cold weather, insulate the battery compartment."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much energy does the heater use?",
    "a": "It varies by model; the MARSENERGY uses a 60W heater. Because it runs from charge input, it slightly slows charging until the cells reach a safe temperature."
