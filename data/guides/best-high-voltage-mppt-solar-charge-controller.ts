export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cold Voc margin",
    "explanation": "Open-circuit voltage rises in the cold, so a string rated 190V at 77F can exceed 200V on a frosty morning. Leave at least 20 percent margin below the cap. Add your string Voc and compare to the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Why high voltage helps",
    "explanation": "Higher string voltage means lower current for the same watts, so you can use thinner wire and lose less to voltage drop. That matters on long runs. A 250V string at 60A is very different from a 60V one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Minimum start voltage",
    "explanation": "MPPT needs panel voltage above the battery to work, and EARNMee lists 70V as the start on 48V. Too few panels in series means no charging. Check the minimum."

  {
    "criterion": "Battery voltage range",
