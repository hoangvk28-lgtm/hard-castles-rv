  "Most home backup advice starts with a wattage number and stops there. A power outage is not a peak, it is a 24-hour day: the refrigerator cycles all night, the furnace fan or a window air conditioner runs in bursts, the sump pump kicks in when the rain does, and the generator has to be refueled at 3 a.m. if the tank cannot last. A rough profile we used for sizing, labelled as an estimate that you should replace with nameplate numbers, is about 900 watts average across the day with short peaks near 2,500 to 3,500 watts when motors start.",
  "We compared six dual-fuel inverter generators from $675.90 to $1,899 against that profile, using only what the listings publish: running and starting watts, tank and runtime claims, the 120V or 240V outlets, and noise figures. Dual fuel is the common thread because propane stores for years and lets you switch when gasoline is scarce, and the picks below spell out which size answers which kind of outage."

    "description": "The Westinghouse iGen5000DFc lists 5,000 peak and 3,900 running watts on gasoline and 4,500 and 3,500 on propane. Its panel has an RV-ready TT-30R 30A outlet, a 5-20R duplex and two USB ports, and the listing claims up to 18 hours at 25 percent load on a 3.4 gallon tank, with noise as low as 52 dBA. A key fob, battery and charger come in the box.\n\nIt ranks first because 25 percent of 3,900 watts is about 975 watts, which is close to our 900 watt average household profile, so the 18 hour claim lines up with a real outage day: roughly 1.3 tanks, or about 4.5 gallons, per 24 hours by simple arithmetic. Against the Generac iQ5200 DF it costs $250 less at $999 and runs 3 hours longer on a comparable load claim, though it has a lower starting rating (5,000 against 5,200). Against the WEN DF680iX it costs $201 more but publishes a 52 dBA figure and an 18 hour runtime that the WEN page leaves out.\n\nPick it if your outage plan is the refrigerator, furnace fan, lights, a sump pump and device charging on extension cords. The caveat is that there is no 240V outlet on the unit itself, so a well pump or panel feed needs the separate parallel kit mentioned in the listing.",

The reasons to pay it are California-legal certification and the explicit air conditioner starting claim, and it is $573.10 above the AIVOLT 4300. By our arithmetic it needs about 1.6 tanks, or roughly 5.1 gallons, to cover a 24 hour day at 975 watts.\n\nChoose it if you live in California or another CARB state, or you want a stated margin for starting a window or RV style air conditioner.

    "criterion": "Running watts against your 24-hour average",
    "explanation": "A generator is rated for its peak, but an outage is a steady load with spikes, and the running figure is what holds for hours. A refrigerator, a furnace fan and lights may average near 900 watts, which is about 25 percent of a 3,900 watt unit's rating. Add up the nameplate watts of what must run, then compare to the running watts on the listing, not the peak."

  {
    "criterion": "Tank size and refuel interval",
    "explanation": "A generator that needs fuel every 6 hours means waking up at night in a storm, and refueling a hot engine is a safety risk. A 3.4 gallon tank at the 18 hour claim of the Westinghouse iGen5000DFc needs about 1.3 refills per day at our estimated load. Divide 24 hours by the listed hours at the closest load percentage, and look for a tank whose claim covers at least the overnight stretch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Motor starting surge",
    "explanation": "Refrigerators, sump pumps and air conditioners pull a brief surge when the motor starts, often several times their running watts. If the starting rating is too low, the generator trips or the motor stalls. Check the starting watts on the listing, such as the Generac iQ5200's 5,200 and its 13,500 BTU air conditioner claim, and compare to the nameplate startup amps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "120V or 240V outlet match",
    "explanation": "A 120V TT-30R outlet powers cords, but a well pump or panel feed on 240V needs an L14-30R or 14-50R. Plugging into the wrong outlet type is not possible without an adapter, and adapters limit capacity. Read the outlet names on the listing, as on the WEN DF680iX and Westinghouse iGen12000DFc, and match them to your pump or inlet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel storage and shelf life",
    "explanation": "Gasoline degrades in months, and varnish in a carburetor is the usual reason a generator fails to start when needed. Propane stores for years in a sealed cylinder, which is why dual fuel suits home backup. Choose a unit with a propane rating, and favor a long propane runtime claim such as the AIVOLT 4300's 34 hours."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Placement and carbon monoxide",
    "explanation": "Every gasoline or propane engine makes carbon monoxide, and it can enter a home through windows, doors or garage gaps. A listing's CO shutdown sensor is a backup, not a license to run it near the house. Plan to place the unit outdoors, well away from openings, and look for a CO sensor on the listing as with the WEN DF680iX and Generac iQ5200."

  {
    "q": "How big a generator do I need for home backup?",
    "a": "Add the running watts of what must run together, then add the largest motor's startup surge. A refrigerator, furnace fan, sump pump and lights often fit in a 3,900 watt class unit, while central air or a well pump needs 5,000 to 9,000 running watts."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a generator into a wall outlet?",
    "a": "Never backfeed through an outlet. It can energize utility lines and injure line workers. Use extension cords to appliances, a power inlet box with an interlock kit, or a transfer switch installed to local code."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Westinghouse iGen12000DFc worth $900 more than the iGen5000DFc?",
    "a": "Only if you need 240V loads or central air. The larger unit publishes 9,000 running watts and 50A and 30A outlets, while the smaller one handles refrigerator, furnace fan and lights on cords at $999."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I switch between gasoline and propane?",
    "a": "Stop the engine, connect the propane hose and regulator per the manual, and use the fuel selector. Some units have an automatic or switch-based fuel selection, so read the specific model's instructions."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a generator for home backup?",
    "a": "Run it monthly for a few minutes, keep propane cylinders sealed, and either use fuel stabilizer or run the carburetor dry on propane before storage. Check the oil level before every use."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a CARB-certified unit matter outside California?",
    "a": "It matters only if you live in a state that requires it. The Generac iQ5200 DF lists 50-state certification, which is the safer purchase if you may move or live in a CARB state."
