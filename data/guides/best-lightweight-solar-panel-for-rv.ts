  "Lightweight is the claim most solar listings make and the spec fewest of them prove. Of the six picks here only the Callsun lists a panel weight, 23.8 lbs each at 51.3 by 30.3 by 1.4 inches, while Renogy says its 200W N-Type panel is 11.7% lighter than the model it replaces without giving a figure.",
  "Nameplate watts also overstate what lands in the battery. As a rule of thumb, multiply watts by sun hours and by about 0.75 for wiring and heat losses: a 200W panel gives roughly 750Wh on a 5 sun hour day, and a 20W maintainer gives about 75Wh. We ranked on that arithmetic, the listed weights and what each kit includes."

The Renogy is lighter in relative terms, but the listing gives no weight number, so liftability for one person remains the open question until you check the product page.\n\nPick this if you want a roof panel you can handle alone and a long written warranty.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {

    "explanation": "Nameplate watts are a lab figure, not what reaches the battery. Multiply watts by sun hours and by about 0.75 for losses: 200W over 5 sun hours is roughly 750Wh. Add up your daily loads in watt-hours and compare, instead of buying on the wattage alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight per panel",
    "explanation": "Lightweight only matters if one person can lift it onto the roof. Callsun lists 23.8 lbs per 200W panel, but Renogy only says its panel is 11.7% lighter than before. Look for a weight in pounds in the title, bullets or spec table, and treat a missing weight as unknown."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller voltage headroom",
    "explanation": "A solar controller has a maximum input voltage, and cold weather raises panel voltage. Two Callsun panels in series reach 54.62V Voc, which cold weather can push higher. Check the controller's maximum input against your panel Voc plus a cold margin before wiring panels in series."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Roof area and mounting",
    "explanation": "A 200W Callsun panel measures 51.3 by 30.3 inches, about 10.8 square feet each. Vents, AC units and skylights shrink usable roof, and some mounts need pre drilled holes. Measure the clear space and check whether the listing includes Z brackets, as SOLPERK and Renogy list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included hardware and total cost",
    "explanation": "The sticker price rarely covers the controller, cable and roof entry gland. SOLPERK's 100W kit includes a 10A MPPT controller, while the Renogy 200W and 50W panels do not. Add the cost of anything missing before comparing dollars per watt."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shade and bypass design",
    "explanation": "On a roof, a single shaded cell can drag down a whole string. Callsun splits each panel into two sections, and Renogy lists bypass diodes on the 50W. Look for bypass diodes or a split cell design in the listing if vents or an AC unit shade part of the roof."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How many watts of solar does a small RV need?",
    "a": "It depends on your daily watt-hours. A fridge, lights and phone charging often total 600 to 1,000Wh, which a 200W panel can roughly cover at 750Wh on a 5 sun hour day. Add up your own loads before choosing."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 20W panel enough to run an RV?",
    "a": "No. A 20W panel such as the Voltset or SOLPERK makes about 75Wh a day, enough to keep a stored battery topped up but not to run a fridge. Choose a larger panel for any real load."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need an MPPT controller?",
    "a": "The SOLPERK 100W kit includes a 10A MPPT controller and Voltset lists MPPT as well, but the Renogy 200W and 50W panels do not include one. MPPT gets more from a panel in cool weather, but check the controller's voltage limits first."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I wire the Callsun panels in series?",
    "a": "Yes, the listing says two panels in series reach 400W at 47.48V Vmp and 54.62V Voc. Check that your controller or power station accepts that input with a cold weather margin, or wire in parallel instead."
  },
  {
    "q": "Where should I mount lightweight panels?",
    "a": "Choose a clear part of the roof away from vents and the AC unit, and use the mounting hardware in the kit. Pre drilled holes and Z brackets are listed for SOLPERK and Renogy, and sealing the screw holes against leaks matters more than the panel brand."
