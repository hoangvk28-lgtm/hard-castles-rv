It measures 9 x 5.4 x 8.2 inches and weighs 20.94 lbs, and the app lets you rename each battery, which is handy when you run two in parallel and want to see both.\n\nThe KeepKnow 100Ah ranked third offers similar Bluetooth and cutoff features for about $80 less, but the WattCycle's case is notably smaller, and its five-year assurance comes with a stated 24-hour support response. Compared with the HQST at number two, it adds an app at the cost of a higher price.\n\nBest for travel trailer owners who may add a second battery later and want both to fit where one lead-acid used to sit.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Exact Case Dimensions",
    "explanation": "Many 100Ah listings call themselves mini, but sizes range from a 9 inch Group 22NF case to a 13 inch Group 31. That difference decides whether one or two batteries fit in your tray, or whether the lid closes at all. Use the length, width, and height in the bullets, not the photo, and measure your box with the cables attached."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charge Cutoff Temperature",
    "explanation": "This is the temperature at which the BMS refuses to accept charge. Because LiFePO4 can be damaged by charging below freezing, the safest listings cut off near 32°F, while some allow charging down to 0°F. Find the exact number in the low-temperature bullet and be cautious with anything well below freezing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length in Writing",
    "explanation": "Similar-looking Amazon listings carry warranties ranging from 36 months to 10 years. A longer written warranty matters more than a lifespan claim because it is the part you can enforce. Look for the warranty term and the support channel, such as a US warehouse or a stated response time."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge Rating",
    "explanation": "Surge describes the short burst current a BMS allows, which helps when a motor or inverter starts up. A battery rated at 100A continuous with a 300A to 500A surge handles startup spikes better than one with no surge rating. Check the bullets for a surge figure and its duration in seconds."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Activation and Charging Notes",
    "explanation": "Some lithium batteries ship asleep and need a lithium-activation or 0V-capable charger to wake up, or after being switched off. This trips up first-time buyers who assume the battery is dead. Read the notes section of the listing before you start the install."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Are the cheap 100Ah lithium batteries on Amazon safe for RVs?",
    "a": "Most use LiFePO4 chemistry, which is stable, and include a BMS. The meaningful differences are in the low-temperature cutoff, warranty, and published certifications, so compare those rather than assuming all 100Ah listings are equal."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I fit two mini 100Ah batteries where one lead-acid used to go?",
    "a": "Often, yes. Cases like the WattCycle at 9 x 5.4 x 8.2 inches are small enough that two may fit in a space built for one Group 27 or 31 battery. Measure the tray before ordering."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the LiTime Xtra-Mini worth it over the HQST 100Ah?",
    "a": "Only if you need its 500A surge or extra brand support. The two are nearly the same size and both include low-temperature charge protection, and the HQST costs about half as much."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my new lithium battery read zero volts out of the box?",
    "a": "Many ship in a sleep mode for safety. A charger with lithium activation, or a brief connection to a charging source, usually wakes the BMS. Check the listing notes for the exact procedure."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire two 100Ah batteries for 200Ah at 12V?",
    "a": "Connect them in parallel, positive to positive and negative to negative, with equal-length cables, and take the main leads from opposite corners of the bank. Charge both fully before connecting so their voltages match."
