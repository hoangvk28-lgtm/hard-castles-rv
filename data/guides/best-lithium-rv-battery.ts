A good lithium pick has to fit your existing battery box, protect itself in freezing weather, and cooperate with the converter and solar controller already installed in your rig.",

    "description": "The Power Queen 125Ah earns the top spot because it solves the most common RV lithium problem: you have a Group 27 battery box and want more than 100Ah without rebuilding the tray. At 12.13 x 6.69 x 8.31 inches it drops into a standard Group 27 space while adding roughly 320Wh over a typical 100Ah lithium of the same footprint, and the built-in Bluetooth 5.0 app reports state of charge, current, power, and cell temperature.\n\nCompared with the ECO-WORTHY 314Ah ranked just below it, the Power Queen carries far less capacity, but it weighs a fraction as much and needs no new mounting space. The ECO-WORTHY is the better pick for a dedicated boondocking bank; the Power Queen is the better pick for the typical travel trailer that wants a clean, low-risk swap. It also lists compliance with ABYC E-13 and UN38.3, documentation many budget brands skip.\n\nBest for weekend and seasonal campers upgrading from lead-acid who want monitoring and a credible safety paper trail. The caveat: it is an energy storage battery only, so it should not double as an engine starter, and confirm your converter has a lithium charge profile before relying on it.",

Against the VATRER 300Ah below it, the ECO-WORTHY offers slightly more capacity and a lower price, but it protects itself in the cold by cutting charging at 19.4°F instead of warming the cells.\n\nBest for dry campers who have floor space inside a basement compartment and want maximum runtime per dollar of quality hardware.

LiFePO4 cells should not be charged below freezing, so standard batteries simply refuse solar or converter charge on a cold morning. This one warms its cells first, which keeps a solar setup useful in shoulder-season and winter camping.\n\nIt sits third because it costs about $100 more than the ECO-WORTHY 314Ah while offering slightly less capacity. The tradeoff is clear: the ECO-WORTHY stops charging when it gets cold, while the VATRER keeps working. Next to the LiFePO4 100Ah picks below it, it is in a different league for runtime, with 5000 rated cycles at 100% depth of discharge and an app that logs cycle count so you can track wear.\n\nBest for RVers who camp in freezing temperatures without shore power.

Against the MARSENERGY 100Ah ranked below, the LiTime costs more and lacks Bluetooth, but its larger Group 31 case and established support network are the reason it ranks higher for overall confidence.\n\nBest for RVers who want two simple, identical batteries and a brand they can reach after the sale.

The brand also notes cells formulated with low-temperature additives, though you should still treat freezing charging as off-limits.\n\nBest for pop-up, teardrop, and small travel trailer owners who want monitoring without moving the battery.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "BMS Continuous Current Rating",
    "explanation": "The battery management system sets how many amps the battery will deliver before shutting itself off. That matters because inverter draw scales fast: a 1000W load pulls roughly 85A to 100A from a 12V battery, so a 100A BMS is at its limit while a 200A BMS has headroom for a 2000W unit. Look for the continuous BMS figure in the title or bullets, and ignore short surge numbers when sizing an inverter."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low-Temperature Charge Protection",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells can be permanently damaged if they are charged below freezing, even though they can discharge in the cold. A battery with low-temperature cutoff simply stops accepting charge, while a self-heating battery warms its cells first so solar keeps working. Check the listing for the exact cutoff temperature, often 32°F or 19.4°F, or the words self-heating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Physical Group Size",
    "explanation": "RV battery trays and tongue boxes are built around BCI group sizes such as 24, 27, and 31, and a battery that is half an inch too long will not close the lid. Lithium lets you fit more amp hours in the same box, which is why a 125Ah Group 27 battery is worth seeking out. Measure your tray and compare it to the listed length, width, and height rather than trusting the word drop-in."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging Compatibility with Your Converter",
    "explanation": "Many older RV converters are built for lead-acid and hold the battery at a float voltage that never fully charges lithium. A LiFePO4 battery wants roughly 14.2V to 14.6V absorption with float disabled or low. Check your converter label for a lithium mode before buying, and budget for a lithium-capable converter if it lacks one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length and Support",
    "explanation": "Most listings promise a 10-year life, but the warranty is the only part of that promise you can enforce. Five years is common among established brands, while some budget batteries carry only one year. Read the warranty line in the bullets and look for a named support channel, not just a lifespan claim."

    "criterion": "Built-In Monitoring",
    "explanation": "Lithium voltage stays nearly flat from 90% to 20% charge, so a simple voltmeter tells you almost nothing about remaining capacity. Bluetooth apps or on-case displays read the BMS and show true state of charge and cell temperature. If a battery has neither, plan on adding a shunt-based monitor, which adds cost to the cheaper picks."

  {
    "q": "Will a lithium RV battery work with my existing converter?",
    "a": "It will usually power the rig, but many older converters charge with a lead-acid profile that never fully charges LiFePO4 and may float it at the wrong voltage. Check for a lithium setting on the converter label. If there is none, a lithium-compatible converter or charger is the usual fix."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I charge a lithium RV battery from my tow vehicle's alternator?",
    "a": "Not directly in most cases. Lithium can pull far more current than lead-acid, which can overheat an alternator, so a DC-DC charger between the vehicle and the RV battery is the standard solution. It also delivers the correct lithium charge voltage."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Power Queen 125Ah worth it over a basic 100Ah drop-in?",
    "a": "If you have a Group 27 tray, yes for most owners. You get 25% more capacity in the same box plus Bluetooth monitoring, for a modest price increase over plain 100Ah batteries like the Mighty Max."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake when switching to lithium?",
    "a": "Mixing a new lithium battery with old lead-acid batteries in the same bank. The two chemistries charge at different voltages, so remove the lead-acid batteries entirely or isolate them, and update your solar controller and converter settings to a LiFePO4 profile."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a lithium RV battery over winter?",
    "a": "Charge it to roughly 50% to 70%, disconnect all loads or use the battery switch so parasitic draws do not drain it, and keep it somewhere above freezing if you plan to charge it. Check the charge every couple of months."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a heated lithium battery?",
    "a": "Only if you charge in freezing temperatures, such as solar charging at a winter campsite. If the battery lives in a heated space or you only camp in mild weather, a standard battery with low-temperature charge cutoff is enough."
