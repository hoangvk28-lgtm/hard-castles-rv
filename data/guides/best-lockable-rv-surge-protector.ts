  "A lockable surge protector only helps if the lock point, the cutoff behavior and your pedestal amperage all line up. Listings love to shout joules while skipping the theft details that decide whether the unit is still there tomorrow. This guide covers two genuine picks, one for 30A rigs and one for 50A, and explains what an anti-theft ring does and does not protect against, so you can decide before you spend."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Real lock provision",
    "explanation": "A lockable unit has a physical loop, ring or hasp that accepts a cable or padlock. Without it, a plug-in protector walks away in seconds because it only hangs from the pedestal. Look for the word ring, hasp or loop in the bullet points, not just 'secure design'."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joules versus fault cutoff",
    "explanation": "Joules measure how much surge energy the internal parts can absorb before wearing out. A cutoff relay is separate and protects against sustained low or high voltage, which is the more common campground problem. Check that the listing names both a joule rating and an automatic cutoff."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match 30A or 50A exactly",
    "explanation": "A 30A unit uses a three-prong TT-30 plug and a 50A unit uses a four-prong plug, and they are not interchangeable. Buying the wrong one means an adapter in the chain, which adds a failure point. Check the plug shape on your inlet before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Manual versus auto reset",
    "explanation": "Auto reset restores power after a fault clears, which can cycle a fridge compressor repeatedly. Manual reset keeps power off until you inspect the cause. Look for the words 'manual reset' or a stated reconnect delay in seconds."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather cover and plug seal",
    "explanation": "Rain and dust on the connection cause more failures than surges do. A cover or IP-rated plug keeps contacts dry, but covers differ in fit. Check for an IP rating or a stated cover size that fits your plug body."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does an anti-theft ring stop someone stealing the pedestal plug?",
    "a": "It slows a thief, because you need a cable lock or padlock through it to be effective. It does not make theft impossible, so treat it as a deterrent."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a 30A protector on a 50A pedestal?",
    "a": "Yes, with a proper adapter, because the protector must match your rig's inlet. Do not use a 50A unit on a 30A rig without checking the amperage rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are 26,000J and 28,000J meaningfully different?",
    "a": "Not in practice, since both are far above typical competitor ratings listed at 9,500 to 15,000J. Fault cutoff behavior matters more."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these units work on generator power?",
    "a": "The listings do not say, so confirm with the seller before relying on them. Some protectors disconnect on generator output."
