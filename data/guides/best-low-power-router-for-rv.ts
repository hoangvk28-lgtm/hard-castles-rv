export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Idle power draw",
    "explanation": "Idle draw is the power used when connected but not heavily loaded. At 1 W, a router draws about 24 Wh per day, a small share of a battery bank. Look for a milliwatt idle figure in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "5G RedCap vs full 5G",
    "explanation": "RedCap is a reduced-capability 5G mode that trades peak speed for lower power. It suits streaming and work but not the fastest downloads. Check the speed and modem class."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Dual SIM and LTE fallback",
    "explanation": "Dual SIM means the router holds two carrier SIM cards, and LTE fallback means it drops to 4G when 5G is weak. This matters in remote campsites where 5G coverage comes and goes. Look for both terms in the product title or bullets before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Enclosure rating",
    "explanation": "IP64 means dust-tight and splash resistant, while IP30 is indoor only. An outdoor mount needs a higher rating. Check the IP rating line."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Power input and ports",
    "explanation": "The router has to accept your RV power source, and every wired device needs an Ethernet port. A mismatch means buying an extra converter or a switch. Check the listing for supply voltage and the number of Ethernet ports."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much power does a low-power RV router use?",
    "a": "These two idle at 756 mW and 840 mW. That is roughly 18 to 20 Wh per day. Load adds more."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with industrial routers?",
    "a": "Assuming they work like a consumer router with an app. These need setup through a web interface or management platform. Plan setup time."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the RX400 worth it over the EX400?",
    "a": "The RX400 gives the lower idle draw and IP64 rating, while the EX400 costs less and has more ports. Choose by whether outdoor mounting or Ethernet matters more."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I power one from an RV battery?",
