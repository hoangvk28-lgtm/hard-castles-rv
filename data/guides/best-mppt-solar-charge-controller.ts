Low-temperature cut-off below 32F stops charging a LiFePO4 battery in freezing weather, and an app connects within about 32 feet.\n\nIt stands above Renogy Rover 20A in rating (40A against 20A) and adds low-temperature cut-off, though it lacks the Rover's surge protection claims. Against EARNMee 60A it gives up amps but offers an app and a more detailed spec sheet.\n\nBest for a RV with a LiFePO4 house bank and about 600W of panels.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Stated tracking efficiency",
    "explanation": "Tracking efficiency measures how closely the controller finds the panel's maximum power point, and figures of 98 to 99.5 percent are common on quality units. It matters because a poor tracker can waste much of the benefit MPPT is supposed to provide. Look for a numeric tracking or conversion figure on the listing, and be cautious when a very low-priced unit gives only the word MPPT."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voc headroom for cold mornings",
    "explanation": "Open-circuit voltage rises as panels get colder, so a 22V panel can read higher than its label on a frosty morning. If the total of your series panels exceeds the controller's maximum PV input, it can be damaged. Add 20 to 25 percent to the panel Voc total and compare it to the limit, such as 95V, 100V or 145V."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Array watts per battery voltage",
    "explanation": "Listings often state a maximum PV wattage for each battery voltage, such as 600W at 12V and 1200W at 24V. Exceeding it can cause clipping, where excess power is simply not used. Match your total panel watts to the 12V figure if your bank is 12V."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold-charging safeguards",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 batteries should not be charged below freezing, so a low-temperature cut-off or a BMS that blocks charging is valuable for winter camping. Without it, the controller may push current into a cold battery and shorten its life. Check whether the listing names a low-temp cut-off or a temperature sensor port."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Monitoring that you will actually use",
    "explanation": "Bluetooth and apps show solar watts, battery voltage and daily harvest, but some modules are sold separately. An LCD is more reliable when you are standing at the controller, while an app is better for a roof or a van interior. Check whether the Bluetooth hardware is included and what the range is."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a 12V MPPT controller with a 24V battery?",
    "a": "Not unless the listing says so. Bateria Power 10A is for 12V only, while Renogy Rover 20A and BougeRV Sunflow 40A auto-detect 12V and 24V. Connecting a 12V-only unit to a higher-voltage bank can damage it."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with a MPPT controller?",
    "a": "Exceeding the maximum PV voltage with a series string on a cold morning. Always add margin to the panel Voc total and keep it below the controller's limit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 99.9 percent efficiency claim believable?",
    "a": "Treat it as a tracking figure rather than total system efficiency. It describes how well the unit finds the maximum power point, not the losses in wiring and conversion. Compare it with the documented numbers on units like BougeRV Sunflow 40A."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the safest way to wire a MPPT controller?",
    "a": "Fuse the battery connection, connect the battery first, then the panels, and use wire sized for the amps. BougeRV Sunflow 40A lists terminals for 15 to 8 AWG, so match your cable to that. On a MPPT controller, double-check polarity at every terminal before powering up and use wire sized for the rated amps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I maintain a MPPT controller?",
    "a": "On a MPPT controller, tighten terminals and inspect cable insulation at the start of each season, and keep vents, fans or heat-sink surfaces free of dust. Mostly just periodic checks. Tighten terminals, keep vents clear and watch for heat. A unit with a fan, like EARNMee 60A, may need dust cleaned out occasionally."
