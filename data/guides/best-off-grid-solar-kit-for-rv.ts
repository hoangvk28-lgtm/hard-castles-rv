export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watts to daily watt-hours",
    "explanation": "Nameplate watts are a peak figure under ideal sun, so daily energy is watts times sun hours, minus losses. 400W for 4 hours gives 1,600Wh before roughly 15 to 25 percent of wiring, heat and controller loss. Multiply the panel total by 4 and subtract a fifth to estimate real harvest."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "MPPT versus PWM",
    "explanation": "An MPPT controller converts extra panel voltage into extra charging current, while PWM simply connects the panel to the battery. In weak sun or cold, MPPT can recover noticeably more energy. Check the controller name on the listing; the ECO-WORTHY 400W and AUECOOR 1440W are MPPT, the other two are PWM."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "System voltage match",
    "explanation": "Panels, controller, battery and inverter must agree on 12V or 24V, or the kit will not work. A listing that mixes a 24V title with a 12.8V battery, as the AUECOOR 1440W does, needs a question to the seller. Confirm the inverter input voltage and controller auto-detect before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller amps and panel wattage",
    "explanation": "A controller has a maximum charging current, so a 40A unit on 12V handles roughly 500W of panels. Oversized arrays waste output past that point. Divide controller amps times battery volts to find its wattage ceiling and compare with your panel total."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery capacity versus recharge",
    "explanation": "A 200Ah 12V bank holds about 2.5kWh, and 400W of panels refills about 1.6kWh a day. Two cloudy days can leave the bank empty before it recovers. Match panel daily Wh to what you use, and keep reserves for two low-sun days."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How much solar do I need for a travel trailer?",
    "a": "Add up daily watt-hours of your loads, then divide by about 4 sun hours and 0.8 for losses. A fridge, lights and a laptop often land near 300 to 400W of panels."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I add panels to a kit later?",
    "a": "Only up to the controller's current and voltage limits, so check the amps. The ZOUPW 220W lists expandable design, while the 30A PWM limit caps how much you can add."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does the ECO-WORTHY 400W run an air conditioner?",
    "a": "Not reliably. A 2000W inverter and 2.5kWh battery cannot sustain a typical 13,500 BTU unit for long, and the AUECOOR 1440W is better suited."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a combiner box?",
    "a": "Only when wiring many panels in parallel. The AUECOOR 1440W includes a 4-to-1 combiner with surge protection for its twelve panels."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is PWM good enough?",
    "a": "For topping up a battery on a small system, yes. For a daily-use bank, MPPT recovers more energy, which is why the ECO-WORTHY 400W ranks above the PWM-only kits."
