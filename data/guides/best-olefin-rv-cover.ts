export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Confirm the fabric is Olefin",
    "explanation": "Olefin is a polypropylene family fabric that breathes while shedding water, and covers made from it feel different from plain non woven polypropylene. Many listings use Olefin as a keyword without naming it in the specs. Look for Olefin or Olefin HD in the title or material bullet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Measure true RV length",
    "explanation": "Cover sizes are matched to overall length, and the ADCO Class A listing says bumpers and the spare tire are included. Leaving out a rear ladder, spare or front hitch is a common reason a cover comes up short. Measure bumper to bumper and pick the range that contains that number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match the RV type",
    "explanation": "Class A, Class C and travel trailer covers are cut with different roof and front profiles. A trailer cover will not fit a motorhome even at the same length. Check that the product name states your exact RV type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Breathability and condensation",
    "explanation": "A cover that traps moisture can cause mildew under it, so breathable fabric matters as much as water resistance. Olefin is chosen for its balance of shedding rain and letting vapor out. Look for the words breathable and water resistant rather than waterproof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Strap and installation system",
    "explanation": "A big cover is hard to pull on alone, so toss weights, buckles and undercarriage straps decide whether it stays on in wind. The ADCO Class A model lists a weighted buckle toss and slip seam strapping. Check the listing for tie downs that run under the RV."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does an Olefin cover work for a travel trailer over 15 feet?",
    "a": "The ADCO trailer cover shown here is sized up to 15 feet, so a longer trailer needs a different cover. Always match the cover length range to your overall measured length."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with cover sizing?",
    "a": "They measure the box and ignore bumpers, ladders and spare tires. The ADCO Class A listing counts bumpers and the spare in its range, so measure the same way."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a Class A Olefin cover worth it over a cheaper cover?",
    "a": "Olefin gives a sun reflecting, breathable top, which matters for RVs that sit outside for months. If the RV is stored indoors or only for a few weeks, a simpler cover may be enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a large RV cover alone?",
    "a": "Use the weighted toss to throw the straps over, then work from one side and cinch the undercarriage straps. The ADCO Class A Olefin is designed around this toss and buckle method."
