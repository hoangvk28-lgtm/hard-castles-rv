  "Portable is a tradeoff, and the listings rarely say what you give up. The six units here weigh from 25.3 to 41.8 pounds and have tanks of 0.66 to about 1.1 gallons, so they are easy to lift but need a refill every 6 to 12 hours, and none lists wheels in its feature text. The lightest unit is not the lightest per watt: dividing listed weight by rated watts gives about 17.8 pounds per 1,000 watts for the heaviest unit and 25.3 for the lightest, which is our arithmetic rather than a claim from the sellers.",
  "We compared six units from $279.29 to $349 on weight, packed dimensions where given, rated and peak watts, tank size, stated runtime, noise and the outlets on the panel. The decision comes down to one question: how heavy a unit can you carry up steps or into a trunk, and how many watts will you give up for it."

  {

The GENMAX 1200 weighs 25.3 pounds for 1,000 watts, about 25.3 lb per 1,000 watts, while the Evernexta 3000 weighs 41.8 lb for 2,350 watts, about 17.8. Divide listed pounds by rated watts for each candidate to compare on the same basis."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carry handle and no wheels",
    "explanation": "None of these listings mentions wheels, so you will lift them. A handle on the top lets you carry one-handed, but a 40 pound unit is a two-handed job up stairs. Look for a top handle, and check whether the weight listed includes a full fuel tank or an empty one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tank size and refill interval",
    "explanation": "Portable units have small tanks, 0.66 gallons on the AIVOLT 1750 and GENMAX 1200, so a night of running means a refill. Refueling a hot engine in the dark is a hazard. Compare the hours stated at a load and tank gallons, and plan to refuel only after the engine has cooled."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated watts for what you will run",
    "explanation": "A portable unit runs small loads. A refrigerator, router and laptop fit inside 1,000 watts, but a microwave or a heater needs 1,500 to 2,000 watts. Add the nameplate watts of your devices, and use the running figure rather than the peak."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise at night",
    "explanation": "Noise matters most when you run overnight beside a tent or a bedroom wall. Listings state dBA at different loads and distances, such as 52 dBA for the AIVOLT 1750 and Westinghouse 1500, and 58 for the Efurden 2800. Compare the distance and load, and place the unit as far from sleepers as the cord reaches."

    "criterion": "Safety shutdown and placement",
    "explanation": "A portable generator is often used near tents and vehicles, where carbon monoxide is the main risk. A CO detect shutdown, listed on the AIVOLT, GENMAX and Westinghouse units, helps but does not replace placing the generator outdoors and clear of openings. Check the listing for a CO sensor and keep the unit on level ground in the open."

    "q": "Can a portable inverter generator run a refrigerator?",
    "a": "Yes, most can. A refrigerator needs about 150 watts running but a few times that at startup, so a 1,000 to 1,600 watt unit such as the GENMAX 1200 or 2000 is enough for it plus lights and electronics."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can two small units be paralleled?",
    "a": "Most here list parallel capability, but a parallel kit is sold separately and units must be compatible. Two 1,000 watt units may be easier to carry than one 2,000 watt unit, though they cost more in total."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Westinghouse 1500 worth $69.01 more than the GENMAX 1200?",
    "a": "Only if you want the 12 hour runtime and the service network. It has the same 1,000 rated watts but is heavier at 32 lb against 25.3 lb."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I carry and run it safely?",
    "a": "Carry it with the tank nearly empty if you can, run it outdoors on level ground away from openings, and let the engine cool before refueling."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these have wheels?",
    "a": "None of the feature texts lists wheels, so plan to lift them. The Evernexta 3000 lists exact dimensions, which helps in planning trunk fit."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a small generator?",
    "a": "Use fuel stabilizer or drain the carburetor, store it upright, and run it for a few minutes each month. Check the oil level before each use."
