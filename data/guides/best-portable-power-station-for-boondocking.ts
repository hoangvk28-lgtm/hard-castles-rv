  "Boondocking power is a 24-hour budget, not a spec-sheet contest. A 12V fridge, a laptop, lights and a phone can eat 600 to 1,000Wh a day, so the useful question is how many sunny hours you need to refill what you used. The five stations here split into two camps: two 2,000Wh-class units that can carry a real camp, and three sub-300Wh packs that cover electronics and a small cooler. Check the output ports and the solar input cap before you trust any capacity number."

    "description": "The Anker SOLIX C2000 Gen 2 pairs a 2,048Wh battery with 2,400W rated and 4,000W peak output, and the listing bundles a 200W bifacial panel. It idles at only 9W on standby, which Anker says runs a dual-door fridge for up to 32 hours. That standby figure matters most when you are camped for days with no hookup.\n\nAgainst the Lipower 2400W it costs $520.00 more ($1,169.99 versus $649.99), and the extra money buys the panel, the 4kWh expansion option and a 58 minute full AC recharge. Pick this if you boondock for several days and want solar in the box. The caveat is that the panel ships separately, so check both parcels arrived.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Daily watt-hour budget",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours (Wh) are the amount of energy stored, so a 2,048Wh station can supply about 2,048 watts for an hour. A fridge averaging 40W uses roughly 960Wh over 24 hours, which would drain a 292Wh pack in under 8 hours. Add up your own devices before shopping and compare the total to the listed Wh."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts are what the inverter can supply steadily, and surge watts are a short burst for motors starting up. A fridge compressor can pull several times its running draw for a second. Check that rated output, not peak, exceeds your largest single appliance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Solar input ceiling",
    "explanation": "Every station caps how many watts of solar it accepts, and extra panel wattage beyond that is wasted. A 100W panel on a 100W input refills about 500Wh on a five sun-hour day. Look for the maximum solar input line in the spec table, not the marketing claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standby draw",
    "explanation": "Standby draw is the power the inverter burns just by being on. A 9W idle uses 216Wh per day, which is why Anker highlights it for fridge runtime. Look for a listed standby or idle figure and a way to switch the AC off."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "One-person liftability",
    "explanation": "A station you cannot carry gets left at home, and a 40 lb unit is hard to move in a tight van. Packs of 6.5 to 8.86 lb are easy to stow in a cabinet. Check the listed weight and dimensions, and treat a missing weight as a warning."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How big a power station do I need for boondocking?",
    "a": "Add up daily watt-hours for every device and aim for 1.5 times that total. A fridge, laptop and lights usually land between 600 and 1,000Wh."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a 300W station run a fridge?",
    "a": "Only a small 12V cooler, and only for part of a day. A 292Wh pack like the Jackery Explorer 300 runs out within hours on a compressor fridge."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is LiFePO4 worth it for off-grid use?",
    "a": "Yes for frequent use, because LiFePO4 cells are rated for thousands of cycles. The Jackery Explorer 300 lists over 4,000, and DaranEner lists over 3,500."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a bigger solar panel than my station accepts?",
    "a": "No, the station caps solar input, and extra wattage is wasted. Check the maximum input before buying panels."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store the station between trips?",
    "a": "Charge it partway and top it up every few months. EnginStar suggests a full charge every 2 to 3 months."
