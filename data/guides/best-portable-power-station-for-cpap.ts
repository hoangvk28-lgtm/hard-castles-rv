export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watt-hours against CPAP draw",
    "explanation": "Runtime equals usable watt-hours divided by your CPAP's draw, and many machines use roughly 30 to 60W without a heated humidifier. A 296Wh unit at 85 percent usable gives about 250Wh, around 6 hours at 40W. Read the wattage on your power supply label, then divide."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Heated humidifier load",
    "explanation": "A heated humidifier can multiply the draw several times, so a station that lasts a night dry can die by morning. If you run one, plan for the higher figure on your label. Turn the heater off or use a rainout-free setting to stretch runtime."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine output",
    "explanation": "Pure sine AC is smooth, as the EnginStar 300W and DaranEner 288Wh list, and sensitive electronics prefer it. Modified output can cause noise or errors on a CPAP motor. Look for pure sine wave in the bullet points, not only a wattage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "12V direct output",
    "explanation": "A CPAP with a 12V cable avoids inverter conversion, which wastes 10 to 20 percent. The DaranEner 288Wh lists a 12V/120W car port and the Powkey 192Wh two 12V 10A outputs. Check your CPAP's DC adapter voltage before relying on this."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "A unit you can lift with one hand is easier to keep by the bed. The ALLWEI 256Wh at 6.4 lb and Powkey 192Wh at 4.7 lb are easy; the LiPower TP300 at 9.2 lb is heavier. Treat an unlisted weight, as with the DaranEner 288Wh, as a question for the seller."

  },
  {
    "q": "Is pass-through charging safe for a CPAP?",
    "a": "The LiPower TP300 lists it, so it can run the CPAP while charging. Check your manual for approved backup-power guidance, since medical use needs reliability."
