  "Home backup asks more of a power station than a camping trip does. A refrigerator runs around the clock, a furnace blower or sump pump has a startup surge, and an outage can last a day or more. That pushes the useful range toward 2kWh and up, with a UPS function that switches over fast enough that a router or CPAP never notices the grid dropped.",
  "We compared capacity, continuous AC output, UPS switch time, expandability with extra batteries, and how fast each unit recharges from the wall or solar. Several of these also have an RV TT-30 port, which makes them useful in a trailer when they are not backing up the house."

Against the PECRON E3600LFP, it is more compact and has a stronger documented UPS, while PECRON offers bigger expansion for less money.\n\nThis suits households wanting a fridge, lights, WiFi, and fans through an overnight outage.

Its advantage is growth: add extra batteries or a smart generator to build a larger system, which the Jackery cannot match. Against the EcoFlow DELTA 3 Max Plus, it has more base capacity and output but older UPS behavior.\n\nThis suits homeowners planning a larger backup system over time.

    "criterion": "Continuous Output vs Boost",
