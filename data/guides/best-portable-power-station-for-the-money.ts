  "Cheap and good value are not the same thing in a power station. A $60 unit and a $470 unit can both say portable, but one stores 97.6Wh and the other 1,024Wh, which is a tenfold gap in what you can actually run. We ranked these five by cost per watt-hour, liftability and the compromises each one hides, then checked what an RV owner gets for the dollars: fridge hours, CPAP nights, or just phone charging. None lists a TT-30 outlet, so shore power stays a separate job."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cost per watt-hour",
    "explanation": "Cost per watt-hour is the price divided by the battery capacity in Wh, and it is the fairest way to compare units of different sizes. A $60 unit at 97.6Wh costs about $0.62 per Wh while a $300 unit at 1,024Wh costs about $0.29, so the cheaper sticker price buys less than half the value. Divide the price by the Wh figure in the title before you compare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous versus surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous output is what the inverter holds steadily, while surge is a brief startup peak. A 200W unit with 270W max cannot run a 600W coffee maker even though surge sounds higher than your load. Compare your appliance's running watts against the continuous number in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry and cycles",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells commonly list 3,000 or more cycles, while basic lithium-ion packs often do not state cycle life at all. That decides whether the unit lasts years of RV trips or needs replacing sooner. Look for the words LiFePO4 and a cycle count in the title or bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry method",
    "explanation": "A power station you cannot lift ends up left in the garage. At 27.73 lbs the STARYLINE is lifted by one person, while a unit with no listed weight is a guess. Check for a stated pound figure and a built-in handle in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recharge speed and sources",
    "explanation": "A 7 hour wall recharge, as on the EnginStar, means the unit is unavailable for a full day after heavy use. Fast AC input, such as 36 minutes to 80% on the OUPES, matters if you stop at campgrounds briefly. Find the stated hours for AC, car and solar input, and the maximum solar watts."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger power station always better value?",
    "a": "Usually yes per watt-hour, since the STARYLINE costs about $0.29 per Wh against $0.62 for the ZeroKor. It stops being better if you cannot lift it or will never use the capacity."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can any of these run an RV air conditioner?",
    "a": "No. Their output tops out at 2000W continuous on the OUPES Mega 1, and an RV air conditioner needs a high startup surge plus a lot of energy per hour that 1,024Wh cannot sustain for long."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do these have a TT-30 RV outlet?",
    "a": "None of the listings mentions a TT-30 outlet. Plan to power items through the standard household outlets, or use an adapter only within the unit's rated watts."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I check a seller's capacity claim?",
    "a": "Look for the Wh number in the title and match it to the battery description. A listing quoting only mAh, like the ZeroKor's 26,400mAh, needs converting: its 97.6Wh figure is the number that matters."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I buy a small unit now and upgrade later?",
    "a": "Only if the first unit has a purpose of its own. The OUPES Mega 1 is the one pick built for later expansion, with up to two B2 batteries."
