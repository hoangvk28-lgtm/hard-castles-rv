    "q": "Should I prioritize price or documented safety certification for portable power stations?",

  },
  {
    "q": "What's the real difference between watts and watt-hours for a power station?",
    "a": "Watts (W) measure how much power the station can deliver at once, essentially how many devices it can run simultaneously, while watt-hours (Wh) measure total stored energy, essentially how long it can run those devices. A station with high W but low Wh can power a lot at once but only briefly."

    "q": "Is LiFePO4 battery chemistry actually safer than standard lithium-ion?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 (LFP) cells are generally considered more thermally stable than standard lithium-ion or lithium-polymer cells, with a lower risk of thermal runaway, and most current portable power stations have shifted to LFP for this reason. Still, verify UL or UL2743 safety certification directly rather than assuming chemistry alone guarantees safety."
