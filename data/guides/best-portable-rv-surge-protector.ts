  "A portable surge protector rides between the pedestal and your RV cord, so it takes the abuse of rain, dropped plugs and bad campground wiring. Joules get the headlines, but fault detection is the part that saves a coach: a good unit cuts power on low voltage, reverse polarity or an open ground instead of just absorbing spikes. These five cover 30 amp and 50 amp rigs. Pick the amp service first, then compare what happens when power goes wrong."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "30A versus 50A match",
    "explanation": "Amp service is the electrical capacity of your RV inlet, and 30A uses a three prong plug while 50A uses four. Plugging a mismatched unit through an adapter can overload wiring. Check the plug on your power cord and buy the same service."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Joules versus protection logic",
    "explanation": "Joules measure how much surge energy a unit can absorb before it wears out. A 16,000 joule unit absorbs more spikes, but only fault logic cuts power for low voltage or reverse polarity. Look for both a joule figure and a named fault list."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low voltage cutoff",
    "explanation": "Low voltage can burn out air conditioner motors faster than a surge. TGJOR lists 103V to 132V as normal, which is a useful reference. Check that the listing names undervoltage protection and a reconnect delay."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating and cover",
    "explanation": "Pedestals sit outside in rain. GEARGO lists an IP68 cover, and Progressive lists a Lexan housing with a weather shield. Look for a stated rating or cover, and avoid units that say only waterproof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Display versus app",
    "explanation": "A display shows voltage at the pedestal, while an app like Power Watchdog's shows live data indoors. Pick the display for simplicity and the app if you travel in areas with poor power. Check that the app is free and the unit works without it."

  {
    "q": "Is a higher joule rating always better?",
