Only three products in this comparison fit that description well, and all three are from VEVOR: a dual-stage filter, a three-stage filter and a portable softener. They share 3/4 inch fittings and a hose-friendly design.",
  "Because the three share a brand, the useful differences are the number of stages, the stated capacity and what each treats. Ranking follows that, and the list is shorter than most because three honest picks beat six padded ones."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Fittings and hose size",
    "explanation": "Portable units use 3/4 inch garden hose fittings. Brass fittings resist leaks better than plastic. Check the thread type and that a hose is included if you need one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and carry",
    "explanation": "Cartridge systems are heavier when full of water. Look for a stated weight and a handle. A single compact unit is easier to store than three canisters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flow rate and pressure",
    "explanation": "A stated GPM and PSI range tells you if it handles campground pressure. A rating of 20 to 125 PSI covers most hookups. Keep a regulator ahead of it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Capacity and refill",
    "explanation": "Gallons per cartridge set decide how often you restock. Compare the stated gallons and your monthly use. For softeners, grain capacity decides how long before regeneration."
