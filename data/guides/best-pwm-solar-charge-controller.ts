export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Panel voltage match",
    "explanation": "A PWM controller pulls the panel voltage down to the battery's level, so any extra voltage above the battery is wasted as heat. A panel with a maximum power voltage near 18V into a 12V battery loses a meaningful share, while a panel with a voltage close to the battery loses little. Check the panel's Vmp on its label and compare it to the battery's charging voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Current rating and array size",
    "explanation": "PWM current is essentially the panel's output current, so size the controller by dividing array watts by battery voltage and adding margin. 300W on a 12V battery is about 25A, so a 30A unit is comfortable while 20A is tight. Avoid buying a unit whose rating equals your array's output with no headroom."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lithium charge profile",
    "explanation": "A LiFePO4 bank generally wants an absorption voltage of roughly 14.2 to 14.6V and no equalization stage. A PWM controller that offers only lead-acid profiles can undercharge or overcharge it. Look for a named lithium mode or a user-adjustable voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Idle battery drain",
    "explanation": "Some controllers draw a small current from the battery around the clock, which matters during storage. Units that list zero consumption at night or under 10mA are better for long-term camping. Look for a stated figure rather than a vague low-power claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Display and protection",
    "explanation": "An LCD shows voltage and current, while LED lights only show status. Look for reverse-polarity, overcharge and short-circuit protection on the listing. Choose a display type you will actually read from the place you will mount the unit."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Does a PWM controller work with lithium batteries?",
    "a": "It can, but the controller must offer a lithium profile or adjustable voltage, and the panels need enough voltage to push past about 14V. Renogy Wanderer Li 30A and AeternaSol 20A list lithium; Depvko 30A PWM does not."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do people make with PWM controllers?",
    "a": "Connecting a high-voltage 24V panel to a 12V battery through a PWM unit. The extra voltage is wasted and the panel is dragged far from its best operating point."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is PWM worth it over MPPT?",
    "a": "For one or two 12V-class panels, yes, because PWM is simple and costs less. Above roughly 400W or with higher-voltage panels, MPPT is the better value."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the safest way to wire a PWM controller?",
    "a": "Connect the battery first, then use the button or menu to select the correct profile, such as LFP, gel or AGM. Always match it to the battery's chemistry. On a PWM controller, double-check polarity at every terminal before powering up and use wire sized for the rated amps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I maintain a PWM controller?",
    "a": "On a PWM controller, tighten terminals and inspect cable insulation at the start of each season, and keep vents, fans or heat-sink surfaces free of dust. Little. Tighten terminals each season and keep the case clear of dust. An LCD unit like Rolokit 20A lets you notice problems earlier by showing voltage."
