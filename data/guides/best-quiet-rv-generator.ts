  "Noise is the reason most campground neighbors resent generators, and many national park campgrounds cap generator noise at around 60 decibels measured from about 50 feet. That makes quietness more than comfort: it decides where you are allowed to run at all. The catch is that listings quote decibels at different distances and loads, so a 52 dBA claim at quarter load and a 58 dBA claim at 22 feet are not directly comparable.",
  "This roundup focuses on inverter generators with documented low noise ratings, then weighs how much power each delivers at that sound level. Honda and Yamaha set the benchmark, but several quieter budget units come close for far less money, and we explain where the difference shows up."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Decibels Need Distance and Load",
    "explanation": "A decibel figure means little without how far away and at what load it was measured, and noise drops noticeably as distance doubles. A rating at 23 feet and quarter load will look much lower than one at 7 meters under full load. Check whether the listing states distance and load, as WEN does with 58 dBA at 22 feet and quarter load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Know the Campground Limit",
    "explanation": "Many national park campgrounds limit generators to about 60 decibels measured at 50 feet, along with set generator hours. A generator rated near 60 dBA at closer distance will usually comply. Check rules for the parks you visit and choose a unit with headroom below the limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Load Determines Real Noise",
    "explanation": "Inverter generators throttle down at light loads, so they are quietest when charging batteries and loudest when starting an AC. A unit running near its limit will be far noisier than its rated figure. Choose enough capacity that your normal load is well below the maximum."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Running Watts for Your AC",
    "explanation": "A 13,500 BTU rooftop AC needs a generator in roughly the 3,000 running watt class for reliable starts, while 2,200 watt units usually need a soft start kit or a parallel partner. Check the listing for a stated AC rating like the Honda EU3200i or Pulsar claims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Eco Throttle and Runtime",
    "explanation": "Eco or Smart Throttle modes match engine speed to load, reducing both noise and fuel use. A larger tank combined with throttle control means fewer refuels and less noisy restarts. Look for runtime at quarter or half load and tank size in gallons."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "CO Shutdown and CARB Status",
    "explanation": "CO shutdown systems turn the engine off when carbon monoxide builds up, and CARB compliance is required to buy certain models in California. The Honda EU2200i in this list is not sold in California. Check both before ordering."

  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do people make comparing generator noise?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Is a Honda EU2200i worth it over the WEN 56235i?",
    "a": "For full-timers and strict campgrounds, yes, because of CO-MINDER, the app, proven reliability, and resale value. For occasional use, the WEN delivers similar running watts at about a third of the price."

  {
    "q": "How can I make my generator quieter at camp?",
    "a": "Point the exhaust away from your RV and neighbors, place it on soft ground rather than pavement, and move it further away with a heavy duty cord. Keep loads light when possible so the throttle stays low."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain an inverter generator for long life?",
