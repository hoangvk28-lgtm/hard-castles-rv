export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Power type and voltage",
    "explanation": "RV ACs come as 120V rooftop units, 12V DC units and split systems. That decides whether you need shore power, a large generator or a lithium bank. Read the voltage on the listing and check that you meet it, including any 12V control feed on a 120V unit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rated BTU, with context",
    "explanation": "BTU is a cooling capacity rating, but manufacturers measure it differently, so an 18,000 BTU unit from one brand may not match another's number. For an RV, capacity also depends on insulation, sun exposure and roof color. Compare BTU only within the same power type and use it with your rig's size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Roof cutout and clearance",
    "explanation": "Most rooftop units fit the standard 14 inch cutout, but height and bracket details vary and ducted units differ from non-ducted ones. A poor fit means extra sealing work. Measure your opening and note whether the unit is listed as non-ducted."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Heating method",
    "explanation": "A heat pump moves heat and works above a certain outdoor temperature, while a PTC or electric strip heater converts watts directly. This matters for shoulder-season use. Check whether the listing says heat pump, heat strip or PTC and what outdoor range it covers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Electrical load",
    "explanation": "A 15,000 BTU rooftop unit draws a large startup surge and needs a proper breaker, and a 12V AC pulls many amps from the battery. This decides whether you can run it on a 30-amp supply or a battery bank. Look for rated amps and watts on the listing, and pair it with a soft start if needed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise and refrigerant",
    "explanation": "Stated dB levels are measured under unknown conditions, and R32 and R410A refrigerants differ in service parts. Noise matters for sleeping, and refrigerant matters for repairs. Treat dB numbers as ranges and check the refrigerant type on the spec sheet."

  },
  {
    "q": "Do the Arsenda 18K and LAOFINA 18K need both 115V and 12V?",
    "a": "Yes, both listings state that. The 12V feed typically supports controls or fan circuits, so plan the wiring and a reliable 12V source."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the ICECOSMOS 12V worth it over a 120V rooftop unit?",

  {
    "q": "How do I know a rooftop AC will fit my roof?",
