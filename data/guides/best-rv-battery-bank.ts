  "A battery bank is more than a bigger battery. It is the decision of how many volts, which chemistry and how you will wire it, because series strings and parallel strings fail in different ways. We picked four options that cover the main paths: one large 12V lithium, a compact 320Ah lithium, a 200Ah AGM and a pair of 6V golf cart style AGMs. For each one we focus on usable energy, expansion limits and the hidden wiring cost of building a bank."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Series or parallel layout",
    "explanation": "Series wiring adds voltage and parallel wiring adds amp hours, and your inverter and charger must match the result. Mixing them up can send the wrong voltage to your RV systems. Check the manual to see the maximum series and parallel count: Power Queen 200Ah lists 4S or 4P."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Usable depth of discharge",
    "explanation": "Lead acid lasts longest when kept above about 50%, while LiFePO4 can be discharged 80% to 100% regularly. A 200Ah AGM therefore delivers about 100Ah, while a 200Ah lithium delivers closer to 190Ah. Look for the cycle life stated at 100% depth in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BMS continuous current",
    "explanation": "The battery management system (BMS) caps how many amps the battery can deliver, and an inverter that asks for more will trip it. At 12V, 2,000W needs roughly 170A or more. Compare the BMS rating, such as the 200A on Power Queen 200Ah, with your biggest load."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable and fuse cost",
    "explanation": "A bank with more current needs thicker cables, bus bars and class T fuses, which can add $100 or more. Undersized wire drops voltage and heats up. Plan the cable run before choosing a battery, and size wire to the BMS limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and placement",
    "explanation": "A heavy bank placed in the wrong spot changes axle load and tongue weight. Lithium like the Power Queen 200Ah is about 55 lbs for 2,560Wh, while AGM listings often do not give weight. Look for a stated weight and confirm the mounting area can hold it."

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I add more batteries later?",
    "a": "Yes, if you stay with the same model and age. Power Queen 200Ah lists up to four in parallel or series."

  {
    "q": "Are 6V batteries better than 12V for a bank?",
