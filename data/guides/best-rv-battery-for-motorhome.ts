  "A motorhome house battery has to survive vibration, dry camping and long stretches between charges. Chemistry matters more than brand: AGM is cheap and proven, LiFePO4 gives far more usable energy per pound. These two 12V 100Ah options show that trade clearly. Keep your chassis starting battery separate, since neither is a starter battery."

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charger and converter compatibility",
    "explanation": "Lithium needs a lithium profile. Check your converter manual. A converter set to an AGM profile may undercharge lithium, leaving a full-looking bank at 80%."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Group size and tray fit",
    "explanation": "The Power Queen G24 is Group 24, the Weize AGM 100Ah is 12.99 x 6.73 x 8.43 inches. Measure your tray. A battery that is taller than the compartment shelf will not close the door or hatch."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold temperature charging limits",
    "explanation": "The Weize AGM lists charging from 14°F. Check low-temperature charge limits for lithium. Lithium charging below 32°F can damage cells, so a cold storage bay needs a heated option or an inside mount."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty length versus price",
    "explanation": "The Power Queen G24 lists 5 years, the Weize AGM 1 year. Compare warranty to price. A one-year warranty on a $169.99 battery is normal for AGM, but a five-year term on lithium spreads the cost over more seasons."
