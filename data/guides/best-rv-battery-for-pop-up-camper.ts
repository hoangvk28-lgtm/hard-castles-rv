  "A pop-up camper asks less of a battery than a big trailer does, but it punishes the wrong choice in two ways: a tongue box with limited room, and a tow weight you feel on every grade. Lights, a water pump, a fan and phone charging rarely need more than 100Ah. So the real decision is lithium weight savings against cheaper AGM that you can charge in freezing weather, and these four picks split on exactly that."

The listing quotes a built-in 100A BMS, IP65 rating and UL/UN38.3 certification, and a 300A surge for 3 seconds. It earns the top spot because weight is the pop-up owner's constant enemy.\n\nAgainst the Renogy AGM at $174.99, the pair costs $170.01 more but gives you two batteries, so per battery it is $172.50, slightly cheaper than the AGM.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Weight on the tongue",
    "explanation": "Pop-up campers carry the battery at the front, so every pound adds tongue weight and affects towing balance. A 100Ah lithium such as the GRNOE lists 22.48 lb, while AGM units in this roundup do not list weight in their bullets. Check the product specification table for shipping or net weight before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging below freezing",
    "explanation": "Lithium batteries can be damaged by charging when cold, so many BMS designs stop charging at 32F. The GRNOE does exactly this, which means a tongue box in a freezing night could leave you without charging from the tow vehicle or solar. Look for a stated low-temp charge cutoff, or self-heating, in the listing bullets."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Amp-hours versus real loads",
    "explanation": "Amp-hours show how much energy the battery holds, but pop-up loads are small: LED lights, a pump, a fan. A 79Ah battery like the UPLUS can run these for a weekend, but a heater fan or fridge changes the math. Add your device wattages, divide by 12V, and compare to about half the rated Ah for AGM."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Group size and box fit",
    "explanation": "BCI group sizes such as 24M define the case footprint, so a replacement drops into your existing tray or tongue box. The Weize and UPLUS list 24M, while the GRNOE lists 12.9 x 6.7 x 8.6 inches. Measure your tray length, width and height, then compare to the dimensions in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Starting versus deep cycle",
    "explanation": "Dual-purpose batteries like the Weize 24M and UPLUS 24M have high CCA, but their plates are optimized for short bursts, so repeated deep discharges age them faster. A true deep-cycle unit such as the Renogy AGM suits nightly camping better. Look for CCA and RC figures in the title to spot dual-purpose designs."

    "q": "Is 100Ah enough for a pop-up camper?",

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a dual-purpose battery as my house battery?",
    "a": "You can, as with the Weize 24M and UPLUS 24M, but they handle repeated deep discharges worse than deep-cycle batteries. If you camp every weekend, the Renogy AGM is the better long-term fit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a lithium battery work in cold weather?",
    "a": "It discharges fine, as the GRNOE lists discharge to -4F, but its BMS cuts charging below 32F. Keep it in a warmer spot or choose an AGM for freezing trips."
