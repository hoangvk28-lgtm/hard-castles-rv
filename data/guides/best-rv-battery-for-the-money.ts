  "The cheapest RV battery is rarely the best value. A $130 lithium that lasts thousands of cycles can cost less per year than a $190 AGM that wears out in a few seasons, while a bargain battery with no cold protection can fail the first frosty morning you charge it.",
  "So we ranked these picks on cost per usable amp-hour and what you get for the money: warranty, low-temperature protection, Bluetooth, and fit. The lineup mixes budget LiFePO4 from RVLithTime, LIPULS, CYCLENBATT, and LiTime with value AGM options from Weize, Mighty Max, and Newport, spanning roughly $130 to $310, with buyer feedback factored in."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cost per Usable Amp-Hour",
    "explanation": "Sticker price hides a lot, because AGM batteries should only be drained to about 50% while LiFePO4 can use most of its capacity. Divide the price by usable amp-hours: a $190 92Ah AGM costs about $4 per usable Ah, while a $130 100Ah lithium costs about $1.30. Do this math with the capacity in each listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Lifetime Cycle Cost",
    "explanation": "A battery that lasts 700 cycles costs far more per use than one rated for 4000. Divide the price by rated cycles at a given depth of discharge to compare. Look for cycle counts tied to a specific depth of discharge, since a number with no DoD is not comparable."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hidden Charging Upgrade Costs",
    "explanation": "Lithium batteries charge best with a lithium profile, and some older RV converters lack one. If you need a new converter or charger, add that to the battery's price. Check your converter's label or manual for a lithium setting before deciding a cheap lithium is the better deal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Included Protections",
    "explanation": "Budget lithium batteries vary in what their BMS covers, especially low-temperature charge protection. Without it, charging on a freezing morning can damage cells and wipe out your savings. Look for an explicit cutoff temperature in the listing, such as stops charging below 32F."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Value",
    "explanation": "Warranty length is part of value, and in this price range it ranges from one to five years. A longer warranty from a seller that handles returns protects your investment. Check both the warranty term and who handles claims, since Amazon often does not process battery returns."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a cheap lithium battery safe for my RV?",
    "a": "LiFePO4 chemistry is generally stable, and every lithium pick here includes a BMS with overcharge and short circuit protection. The main risk with budget models is charging below freezing without a cutoff. Choose a battery with a stated low-temperature cutoff if you camp in cold weather."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common mistake when buying a budget RV battery?",
    "a": "Comparing sticker prices instead of usable capacity. A cheap AGM may look like a deal, but only half its rating is usable and it wears out sooner. Compare cost per usable amp-hour and cycle life instead."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a $300 lithium worth it over a $130 one?",
    "a": "Sometimes. A pricier battery like the LiTime adds Bluetooth, clearly stated cold cutoffs, and brand support, which the RVLithTime lacks. If you camp in cold weather or value monitoring, the extra may be worth it; for mild-weather use, the cheaper battery delivers the same energy."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I switch from lead acid to a budget lithium battery?",
    "a": "Check that the new battery fits your tray, then set your converter or solar controller to a lithium profile if it has one. Disconnect negative first when removing the old battery, connect positive first on the new one, and secure it firmly. If your converter has no lithium setting, consider upgrading it."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I buy one 100Ah lithium or two cheap AGMs?",
    "a": "One 100Ah lithium typically gives about the same usable energy as two 100Ah AGMs, at a fraction of the weight and often a similar price. Lithium also lasts many more cycles. Two AGMs make sense only if you need cold charging without heated batteries or have an older converter."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I make a budget battery last longer?",
    "a": "Avoid deep discharges on AGM, keep lithium above freezing when charging, and use correct charge settings. Store lithium partially charged and disconnected, and keep AGM fully charged with periodic top-ups. A battery monitor helps you avoid accidental deep drains."
