  "A travel trailer battery lives in a tight tongue box or a front compartment, so the first question is not amp hours, it is whether the case fits and whether the trailer's converter can charge that chemistry. We kept this roundup to four 12V picks that match common trailer loads: a fridge on DC, lights, a water pump, a furnace fan and the occasional inverter run. Two are lithium, two are lead acid, and each one carries a real fit or charging catch you should know before ordering."

Because it matches the Group 24 footprint, it drops into most tongue boxes that held a lead acid battery, and the listing rates it at 4,000+ deep cycles.\n\nAgainst the Power Queen 150Ah it costs $88.90 less ($311.09 versus $399.99) but gives up about a third of the capacity. Against the Renogy AGM it costs $146.60 more, which buys the weight savings and deeper usable capacity. Pick this if your box is Group 24 and you want one simple swap.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Group size and tray fit",
    "explanation": "BCI group size (24, 27, 31) sets the case length and width, and a 2 inch mismatch means the battery will not seat in a tongue box. A battery that slides around loses terminal contact and can short against metal. Measure the tray, then confirm the group size in the listing title before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Usable versus rated capacity",
    "explanation": "Rated amp hours are not usable amp hours: lead acid is normally kept above 50% charge, while lithium can be discharged much deeper. That makes a 100Ah AGM act like about 50Ah, which a fridge and furnace can drain overnight. Check whether the listing states the discharge depth or cycle count at 100% depth."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Converter charge profile",
    "explanation": "Many trailer converters were built for lead acid and charge at a fixed voltage, which can leave lithium partly charged. A partly charged lithium battery reports lower runtime than the label suggests. Look in your converter manual for a lithium mode, or plan a small upgrade charger."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold charging behavior",
    "explanation": "Lithium cells can be damaged if charged below freezing, so most LiFePO4 batteries cut off charging near 32F. A trailer stored outdoors can lose charging entirely on a frost morning. Look for the words low temperature cutoff or self heating in the listing, and note that LiTime G24 lists cutoff without a heater."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight on the tongue",
    "explanation": "Every pound in the front box adds tongue weight, which affects tow stability and hitch loading. A 21.9 lb lithium battery adds far less than a typical 60 lb AGM. Check the listed weight, and treat a missing weight as a warning sign."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Will a lithium battery work with my trailer's stock converter?",
    "a": "It usually charges, but a lead acid converter often stops around 13.6V, which leaves lithium partly full. Check your manual for a lithium mode or add a charger with a LiFePO4 profile."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is 100Ah enough for a travel trailer?",
    "a": "For lights, a water pump and a furnace fan over a weekend, yes with lithium like the LiTime G24. A DC fridge plus furnace in cold weather may need the Power Queen 150Ah."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I mix an AGM and a lithium battery?",
    "a": "No, mixing chemistries on one bank causes uneven charging and shortens both. Choose one chemistry per bank and replace together."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does the Interstate G24 AGM suit house loads?",
    "a": "Only light ones. At 70Ah it is a dual purpose battery with 750 CCA, so it fits generator starting better than long fridge and furnace runs."
