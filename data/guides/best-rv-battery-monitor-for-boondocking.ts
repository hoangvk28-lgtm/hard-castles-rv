It ships with a 300A/75mV external shunt, uses a 16-bit ADC to count amp-hours in and out, and works on 12V to 100V systems with lithium, AGM or lead-acid. At $41.99 it is the one that gives you real state of charge.\n\nAgainst the ANCEL BM300 ($35.99), you pay $6.00 more and gain actual coulomb counting, a 20% low-capacity alarm and programmable voltage alarms.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Shunt versus voltage-only readings",
    "explanation": "A shunt is a precision resistor in the negative cable that lets the monitor count current in and out. A voltage-only monitor guesses charge from battery voltage, which swings with load and temperature, especially on LiFePO4 where the curve is nearly flat. Check the listing for the words shunt, amps and amp-hours, not just voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shunt amp rating for your inverter",
    "explanation": "The shunt must handle your peak current, not your average. A 2000W inverter on 12V pulls roughly 170 amps, so a 300A shunt has headroom while a 100A one would overheat. Divide your largest inverter watts by 12 and compare it to the printed amp rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery voltage range supported",
    "explanation": "Some monitors only accept 9V to 16V, which suits one 12V battery but not a 24V or 48V bank. Others, like the Coolschmax CZ212, accept 12V to 100V. Read the listed voltage range and confirm it covers your future upgrade."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Alarm type and where you hear it",
    "explanation": "A low-capacity alarm is useful only if you notice it. A buzzer on the display works inside the rig, while an app alert needs your phone in range, about 10 meters on the KDator BM2. Check whether the alarm is audible, app-based, or both."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Setup and resync routine",
    "explanation": "Coulomb counters drift, so they need a capacity entry and a full-charge sync. The Coolschmax CZ212 lets you set capacity once and sync 100% on a full battery. Look in the listing for how SOC is reset and how long calibration takes."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Is a voltage-only monitor enough for boondocking?",
    "a": "It works for a single battery with light loads and daily recharging. For inverter use or multi-day stays, a shunt is the better bet because voltage hides load sag."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can the ANCEL BM300 replace a shunt monitor?",
    "a": "No. It is a 12V Bluetooth tester that reads voltage and runs cranking and charging tests, not amp-hours. Use it on the chassis battery, not as a house-bank gauge."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does the Coolschmax CZ212 work with lithium?",
    "a": "The listing says it works with lithium, LiFePO4, lead-acid, gel and AGM batteries on 12V to 100V systems. Confirm your chemistry on the product page before ordering."
  },
  {
    "q": "What size shunt do I need?",
    "a": "Divide your largest inverter wattage by battery voltage and add margin. A 2000W inverter on 12V is roughly 170 amps, so a 300A shunt gives comfortable headroom."
