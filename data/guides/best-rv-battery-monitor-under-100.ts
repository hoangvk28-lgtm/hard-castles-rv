  "Under $100 you can still get a real coulomb-counting monitor with an external shunt, but the cheapest units quietly drop things that matter in an RV: shunt rating, app access, or a listed amp ceiling. We ranked these five by what each one measures, how much current it can safely handle, and what you give up as the price falls. The ranking is about ownership cost and replacement risk, not the sticker price."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Shunt amp rating",
    "explanation": "The shunt is a resistor that measures current, and its amp rating sets how much load the monitor can safely read. If a 2000W inverter pulls about 167A at 12V and the shunt is rated for 100A, it can overheat or read wrongly. Check the listing title and bullets for a number like 350A or 400A, not just a range of voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage range versus system",
    "explanation": "Monitors list a working voltage range such as 10 to 100V, which determines whether it handles 12V, 24V or 48V banks. Using one outside its range can fail or give wrong readings, as with the QWORK's title and bullets disagreeing on 80V and 100V. Confirm your bank voltage falls clearly inside the stated range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "App and remote access",
    "explanation": "WiFi and Bluetooth let you check state of charge from bed without walking to the battery bay. The Aurikall and Zunate list both, while the QWORK, SUPNOVA and DROK do not. Look for the words WiFi or Bluetooth in the title, not only a color screen."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chemistry setting",
    "explanation": "Voltage curves differ between lead-acid and LiFePO4, so a monitor set to the wrong chemistry shows the wrong percentage. The SUPNOVA defaults to 12V lead-acid, so a lithium bank needs a manual change. Check whether the listing names LiFePO4 support and mentions a setup menu."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature input and alarms",
    "explanation": "A temperature probe shows battery heat or cold, which matters since lithium charging is limited near freezing. The DROK includes a 60cm probe, and the SUPNOVA can show temperature on its display. Look for a probe or temperature mention and a programmable buzzer."
