  "The word system in a battery monitoring system usually means more than one piece: a sensor on the battery, a display or app, and a way to see your readings when you are not standing next to the rig. That raises questions a simple monitor never faces, such as whether data reaches your phone over Bluetooth or WiFi, whether the sensor needs your main cable cut, and what happens to your readings when the battery drops out.",
  "We compared five units from $36.50 to $87.96 that make remote access or easy installation the point: a Renogy kit with a Bluetooth module, an AILITRON with an app, two WiFi and Bluetooth units sized for 50 and 100 amp loads, and a Hall effect sensor that clamps over the cable with no shunt at all. Wired display-only monitors and the classic Victron picks are in our sibling guides, so this one stays on remote visibility and install method."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Bluetooth versus WiFi reach",
    "explanation": "Bluetooth connects only within roughly 10 meters of the monitor, so it tells you nothing from inside a store or from home. WiFi through an app can reach you anywhere, provided the rig has a network. Check whether the listing says WiFi, Bluetooth or both, and whether the WiFi link needs a router or hotspot at the rig."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Current range of the sensor",
    "explanation": "A monitor that tops out at 50 amps cannot meaningfully read a 1,000 watt inverter drawing about 85 amps at 12 volts. Exceeding the range can damage the sensor or give wrong numbers. Size the range above your largest sustained load, and read the current range rather than the maximum voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shunt versus Hall effect",
    "explanation": "A shunt measures the small voltage across a precision resistor and is accurate even at tiny currents, but installing it means breaking the main negative. A Hall sensor measures the magnetic field around the cable, avoids cutting but can drift with temperature. Choose based on whether you are willing to rewire the negative."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Data retention and sync",
    "explanation": "When a battery disconnects, a monitor without memory forgets its amp-hour count and shows a wrong state of charge on reconnect. Look for power-off memory and a way to set 100 percent after a full charge. Check the listing for the words memory or stores data."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Listing consistency",
    "explanation": "Several listings here contradict themselves, for example a title that says 500 amps while the body names 50, 100 and 350 amp shunts, or an accessory whose job is not explained. Contradictions mean you could receive a smaller part than you expected. Read the title and the bullets together and ask the seller before ordering."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Alarms and protections",
    "explanation": "A buzzer alarm is only useful if you are near it, while an app alert can reach you. Overcurrent and over-temperature protections only matter if they act on something, not just warn. Check whether each alarm is a notification, a buzzer or a relay output."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between a battery monitor and a monitoring system?",
    "a": "A monitor is a single meter, while a system adds remote visibility, app history and sometimes alarms that reach your phone. Most owners who want alerts need the system type, but anyone who only checks at the rig can use a simple display."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does WiFi monitoring work without internet at the campsite?",
    "a": "Generally the unit needs a network it can join, such as a hotspot or the RV's router, for remote access. Without one, Bluetooth near the rig may still work. Check the listing for how the remote link works."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Zunate worth $14.32 more than the Hamwesh?",
    "a": "If your largest load is above 50 amps, yes, because the Hamwesh stops at 50 amps and the Zunate reads to 100. For lights and a small fridge, the Hamwesh is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a no-shunt Hall monitor?",
    "a": "Thread the main negative or positive cable through the sensor's 20 millimeter hole with the arrow in the right direction, connect the display to the system voltage, then set your battery capacity. No cable cutting is needed."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my state of charge drift?",
    "a": "Every counting monitor accumulates small errors and needs a resync when the battery hits a full charge. Charge to full once in a while and press the 100 percent sync, and the reading will realign."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do Bluetooth modules drain the battery?",
    "a": "Every always-on electronics draws some current, typically milliamps. For a stored rig, check the listing for standby draw, and consider unplugging the module if the rig sits for months."
