  "Many travel trailers do not have a separate converter box at all. The converter lives inside a WFCO WF-8900 series power center, the same panel that holds the breakers and DC fuses, and the part that actually charges the battery is a slide-out main board assembly, usually labeled WF-8955-MBA. If you just moved to LiFePO4, replacing that one section is often the cleanest way to get proper lithium charging without rebuilding the panel.",
  "So this guide sticks to 55 amp drop-in sections for that panel family. We compared how each one reaches the 14.6V a 12V LiFePO4 battery needs, whether the mode is automatic or locked by a switch, how exactly it fits the WF-8955 footprint, and what warranty backs it. Five units genuinely fit the brief; the rest of the market was standalone converters better covered in our other guides."

It also has a load-based cooling fan that ramps with demand instead of waiting for heat, and a 5-year warranty, both of which put it ahead of the WAVLINK below.\n\nThis is the best fit for most owners upgrading to LiFePO4 in a WF-8900 panel. The caveat: measure first. Rugaest lists 9.53 x 7.17 x 3.56 inches and asks you to compare mounting holes and wire routing with your existing section.",

It costs the same as the Onylraep below but offers that fixed voltage mode, useful for a battery maker that specifies an unusual setpoint.\n\nPick it if you want flexibility in a WF-8955 slot.

If you have committed to lithium for good, that simplicity can be a plus because nothing can be bumped into the wrong mode.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "14.6V lithium charge voltage",
    "explanation": "A 12V LiFePO4 battery reaches full near 14.2 to 14.6V, while many original WF-8955 boards sit near 13.6V. At 13.6V the battery fills slowly and often stops well below full, so your 100Ah may behave like far less. Confirm the listing names 14.6V or a similar lithium bulk voltage, not just the words lithium ready."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Exact board compatibility",
    "explanation": "WF-8900 series panels use slide-in main board assemblies, and model suffixes such as AD, AN, PEC, and REP matter. A board that does not match can leave wires short or mounting holes off. Read the label on your current section and match it to the listing's compatibility list, then compare dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hold voltage after charging",
    "explanation": "Unlike lead-acid, LiFePO4 does not need a constant float and is happier resting a little below full. A section that drops to around 13.6V or a trickle mode after bulk keeps loads running without stressing cells on long hookups. Look for a stated float, idle, or trickle voltage in the description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mode switch or auto-detect",
    "explanation": "Auto-detect boards choose a profile based on battery behavior, which can be fooled by solar input or a deeply discharged bank. A labeled switch costs nothing in convenience once set and removes the guess. Check whether the listing describes the indicator light for each mode so you can verify it later."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cooling inside the panel",
    "explanation": "The section lives in a closed power center, often under a cabinet, so heat builds when it runs near 55 amps. Fans that ramp with load act before temperature climbs, while heat-triggered fans react later. Look for a description of fan control and make sure the panel vents are clear after install."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Low-temperature charging protection",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 should not be charged below about 32F, and none of these sections measure battery temperature. That job falls to the battery's BMS or a self-heating battery. Before winter camping, check your battery's spec sheet for a low temperature charge cutoff."

export const faq = [

  },
  {
    "q": "Do I have to replace the whole power center to use LiFePO4?",
    "a": "Usually not. The charging circuit lives in the main board assembly, so swapping just that section, like the Rugaest WF-8955-MBA, upgrades charging while keeping your breakers and fuses."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the genuine WFCO board worth it over a clone?",
    "a": "It is worth it if warranty or dealer service matters, since it is the original part. Otherwise the clones here document a 14.6V lithium mode and longer warranties for a fraction of the price."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I swap the main board safely?",
    "a": "Disconnect shore power, switch off any inverter, and remove the battery negative. Photograph the wiring, remove the screws and leads, slide in the new section, reconnect every wire to the matching terminal, and restore battery then shore power."
  },
  {
    "q": "What happens if I leave a switchable board in lead-acid mode with LiFePO4?",
    "a": "The battery will charge to around 13.6V and stop short of full, so usable capacity drops. It is not usually dangerous, but switch to lithium mode and confirm the indicator light."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I go back to lead-acid with the SUPLIFE board?",
    "a": "Not properly. It charges only to a lithium profile, so a lead-acid battery would not receive the correct staging; choose a switchable section if that is a possibility."
