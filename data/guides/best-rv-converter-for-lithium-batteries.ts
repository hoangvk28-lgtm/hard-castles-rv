  "Small trailers, teardrops, truck campers, and van builds rarely need the 55 to 100 amp converters sold for big fifth wheels. A 35 or 45 amp unit is often enough to run the lights and fan while topping up a single lithium battery, and it is gentler on a battery whose BMS limits charge current. What matters more at this size is getting the lithium voltage right.",
  "For this roundup we looked at standalone converters you can mount on their own, separate from a power center. We compared how each sets a lithium charge, whether by adjustable output, a dedicated mode, or automatic detection, plus the amp size, protections, and how much rewiring the install takes. One larger 75 amp unit is included for owners who need headroom."

Its output adjusts from 13V to 16.5V DC so you can set it to your battery maker's charge voltage, and its 3-stage routine of bulk, absorption, and float covers AGM, gel, flooded, and LiFePO4.\n\nCompared with the WFCO WF-9835-AD-CB ranked second, it trades automatic detection and UL listing for adjustability and about $64 in savings. It also outclasses the PM3-45-SME below on documentation, with protections for reverse polarity, overload, and thermal shutdown spelled out, and PowerMax says the install takes under 10 minutes without rewiring.\n\nPick this for a teardrop, van, or small trailer with one or two lithium batteries. The caveat is that adjustability cuts both ways: setting it near 16.5V by mistake can trip a LiFePO4 BMS, so check the voltage with a meter after setup.",

It recognizes lead-acid or LiFePO4 and adjusts its multi-stage charging on its own, keeps full output down to 100 volts of shore input, and is UL/CSA listed and FCC compliant.\n\nIt ranks second because it costs about $193 for 35 amps, the least current here at the highest price, and you cannot fine-tune the voltage like the PowerMax PM4 above. In exchange you get third-party safety certification and nothing to adjust. Compared with the PowerMax PM3-45-SME below, it gives up 10 amps but adds certification and low-voltage tolerance.\n\nThis suits a small trailer owner who wants set-and-forget lithium charging from an OEM brand.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Amp rating matched to the battery",
    "explanation": "A converter's amp rating is the most current it can deliver to loads and battery together. Small lithium batteries often accept only 20 to 50 amps of charge, so a huge converter brings no benefit and can trip the BMS. Compare the converter rating with the max charge current on your battery spec sheet before choosing a size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "How the lithium voltage is set",
    "explanation": "Lithium charging depends on reaching about 14.2 to 14.6V. Some units adjust by dial, some have a dedicated LiFePO4 mode, and some detect the battery automatically, each with a different chance of user error. Read how the listing says lithium is selected, and avoid units that only say compatible without a mechanism."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fixed and maximum voltage limits",
    "explanation": "Several units can output up to 16.5V for special uses. That is well above a 12V LiFePO4 battery's safe range, and an accidental setting can trigger BMS shutdown. Note the maximum voltage in the listing and plan to verify your setting with a multimeter."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standalone wiring needs",
    "explanation": "A standalone converter needs its own AC feed, DC cables to the battery or fuse panel, and correct fusing. In a van build that is easy to plan; in a trailer it may mean running new cable. Check the manual for cable gauge and fuse size, and add those parts to your budget."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shore power tolerance",
    "explanation": "Low campground voltage can reduce some converters' output, slowing charging. A published minimum input voltage at full output shows the unit was designed for weak pedestals. Look for a number like the WFCO's 100V rating instead of a broad input range alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Protection and certification",
    "explanation": "Reverse polarity, overload, and thermal protection guard against wiring mistakes and hot compartments. A UL or CSA listing adds independent safety review. Check the listing for named protections and an explicit certification mark."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a special converter for lithium batteries?",
    "a": "You need one that can reach a lithium charge voltage near 14.2 to 14.6V. A standard 13.6V converter will run loads but leaves LiFePO4 undercharged; units like the PowerMax PM4 45A or WFCO WF-9835-AD-CB solve that."
  },
  {
    "q": "What size converter do I need for a single 100Ah lithium battery?",
    "a": "Around 35 to 45 amps is a practical match for most 100Ah batteries, which often accept about 50 amps of charge. The PowerMax PM4 45A fits that range."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the WFCO auto-detect worth it over an adjustable PowerMax?",
    "a": "If you want no settings and a UL/CSA listing, yes. If you are comfortable using a meter, the adjustable PowerMax gives more control for less money."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set an adjustable converter for lithium?",
    "a": "Check the battery's recommended charge voltage, set the converter to that value with the battery disconnected, and confirm with a meter. Then reconnect and watch voltage rise during charging."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a converter heat or protect my lithium battery in the cold?",
    "a": "No. These converters do not monitor battery temperature, so rely on a battery with a low temperature charge cutoff or a heater, and avoid charging LiFePO4 below about 32F."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a bigger converter always better?",
    "a": "No. Beyond your battery's accepted charge current, extra amps only add cost, cable size, and heat. The 75 amp PowerMax PM3-75LK makes sense only with two or more batteries."
