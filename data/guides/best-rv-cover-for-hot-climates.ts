export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "UV-treated top fabric",
    "explanation": "UV rays break down fabric, roof seals and decals, so the top layer takes the damage. A UV coating or treatment slows that. Look for a named UV treatment in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Breathable construction",
    "explanation": "In hot weather, a sealed cover traps heat and humidity, which cooks sealants and encourages mildew. Vents and breathable layers release it. Count vents and look for the word breathable plus specifics."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Light vs dark color",
    "explanation": "Lighter colors reflect more heat, while darker covers absorb it and warm the roof surface. The effect is small but real in direct sun. Check the color options in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Body-specific cut",
    "explanation": "Fiberglass campers, trailers and Class C motorhomes have different shapes. A mismatched cover leaves gaps for wind and sun. Read the listed body type, not just the length."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Zip access",
    "explanation": "Rollable zipped panels let you check on the interior or reach storage without lifting the entire cover. This saves time and wear in summer. Check how many doors and on which sides."

  {
    "q": "Does a light-colored cover help?",
    "a": "Lighter shades reflect more sun and run cooler. The effect is modest but adds up in direct sunshine."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I remove the cover between trips?",
    "a": "For short gaps, leave it on with zip doors rolled for airflow. Remove it for long idle stretches to check the roof."
