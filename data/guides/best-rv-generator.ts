  "Most trailers are wired for 30 amp service, and 30 amps at 120 volts is 3,600 watts, so a generator bigger than about 4,000 watts cannot push more than 3,600 of it through a single TT-30 plug. That fact reshapes the shopping question: the useful number is not the biggest watt label but how many rated watts you get on the fuel you will actually burn, whether the output is clean enough for electronics, and whether the plug on the panel is the one your trailer cord expects. Starting watts, quoted in large type on most listings, only last a few seconds.",
  "We compared six RV-ready generators from $369.99 to $798, all of which list a 30A outlet, with attention to rated watts per fuel, runtime figures, noise and weight where the listing states them. This is the hub page, so each pick below says who should buy it and who should skip it, and the narrower guides on this site cover specific wattage classes in more depth."

That flat rating across both fuels is unusual in this price class. It has a TT-30R RV receptacle, four three-prong 120V receptacles, a 12V DC outlet, two USB ports, wheels and a telescoping handle, and the WEN Watchdog sensor shuts it down if carbon monoxide builds up.\n\nIt costs $647, which is $151 less than the WEN DF680iX and $7.01 more than the Champion 4000. Against the Champion it adds 1,000 more rated watts (4,000 versus 3,000 running) and dual-fuel flexibility, but it does not list a decibel figure, only a comparison to normal conversation. Against the budget picks it is $248 more than the Westinghouse 4650 ($647 versus $399) and delivers 400 more rated watts on gasoline.\n\nPick this if one rooftop air conditioner plus other trailer loads is your normal summer scenario and you want the same output whether you run gas or a propane tank. The caveat is that only 3,600 of those 4,000 watts can leave through the TT-30 plug, so the remainder is reachable only through the 20A outlets, and the listing does not publish weight.",

Against the EFURDEN 4300 it is $250 more ($639.99 versus $389.99) and the EFURDEN lists 300 more running watts, so the Champion's premium is paid for lower weight, a published noise figure, the three-year warranty and the optional parallel kit, not for output.\n\nPick this if you carry the generator in and out of a truck bed yourself and expect to run a single rooftop air conditioner with modest other loads. The caveat is that 3,000 running watts leave little room for a second large appliance, and the parallel kit that doubles output is sold separately.",

    "criterion": "The 30A plug shape",
    "explanation": "RV shore cords use a TT-30P plug, and a generator with a TT-30R receptacle takes it directly. Many listings say 30A but supply an L5-30R twist-lock, which needs a small adapter, and a few do not state the shape at all. Look for 'TT-30R' in the outlet list, and plan for an adapter if you only see L5-30R."

  {
    "criterion": "Inverter versus conventional output",
    "explanation": "Inverter generators produce clean power, with distortion usually listed under 3 percent, which protects laptops, TVs and the electronics in newer converters. Conventional generators can output a rougher waveform. Check the listing for a total harmonic distortion number, since a model that does not mention inverter technology should be treated as conventional."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Carbon monoxide shutdown",
    "explanation": "A generator can kill a sleeper in a camper when exhaust drifts toward a window, and an automatic shutdown sensor shuts the engine off when CO levels climb. It is a backup, not a license to run the unit close to the RV. Look for the sensor named in the listing (WEN Watchdog, CO Shield) and keep the generator several feet from windows and vents."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel runtime at realistic load",
    "explanation": "Runtime figures are quoted at a specific load, often 25 percent, and drop quickly under a running air conditioner. A 1.6-gallon tank giving 8 hours at 25 percent load is about 0.2 gallons per hour, but at half load or more it will be much shorter. Check the load the listing uses before comparing hours between models."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight, noise and warranty",
    "explanation": "Under 50 pounds is a one-person lift; open-frame models above that often need a ramp or a second person. Noise is quoted at 23 feet and runs from 60 to 64 dBA in the listings that state it. Warranty ranges from two to three years here, so read what is covered before registering."

    "q": "How big a generator do I need for a 30 amp RV?",
    "a": "A 30 amp service tops out at 3,600 watts, so a generator with about 3,600 to 4,000 rated watts covers it. Add up your running loads (an air conditioner, fridge and electronics) and leave 20 percent headroom. Anything above 4,000 rated watts is only useful for the other outlets, since the TT-30 plug cannot pass more than 3,600W."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug a 50 amp RV into one of these generators?",
    "a": "Only with a 30A to 50A adapter, and the whole rig then runs from a single 30A supply with a 3,600W ceiling. Both legs of a 50 amp panel will share that one leg. Turn off the second air conditioner and big appliances before starting."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the WEN DF680iX worth $151 more than the DF480iX?",
    "a": "Only if you need 5,100 rated watts, a 240V outlet or home backup. For a single-air-conditioner trailer the DF480iX already has 4,000 rated watts on both fuels, more than the 3,600W the TT-30 can carry."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a generator to my trailer safely?",
    "a": "Place it outdoors on level ground at least several feet from windows and vents, with the trailer's main breaker off. Plug the shore cord into the TT-30R (or into an L5-30R adapter), start the engine, wait for it to settle, then switch the breaker on and start loads one at a time."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does propane lower the wattage?",
    "a": "Propane has less energy per volume than gasoline, so the same engine makes less power on it. The Westinghouse 4650 drops from 3,600 to 3,240 rated watts, the WEN DF680iX from 5,100 to 4,500, while the WEN DF480iX holds 4,000 on both."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I store a generator between trips?",
    "a": "Run it until the carburetor is empty or add fuel stabilizer, and keep propane tanks upright outdoors. Change the oil on the manual's schedule and run the engine briefly each month. WEN's fuel shutoff helps by burning off carburetor fuel before shutdown."
