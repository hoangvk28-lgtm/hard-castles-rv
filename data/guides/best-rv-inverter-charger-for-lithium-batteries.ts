  "Swapping lead-acid batteries for LiFePO4 is only half an upgrade if the charger still runs a lead-acid profile. Lithium wants an absorption voltage around 14.2 to 14.6 volts, a float that is low or disabled, and no equalization cycle, and a charger stuck on the wrong profile either undercharges the bank or keeps tripping the battery's BMS near full. An inverter charger that handles this correctly replaces your converter, adds household AC from the battery, and switches between shore power and the bank automatically.",
  "We compared each unit on how it handles lithium (a dedicated LiFePO4 mode or a user-adjustable profile), charger current, transfer time, efficiency, and certification for RV and marine use. The range goes from about $330 value units to premium hardware over $2,000, and the price gap buys configurability and proven installs more than raw watts."

    "description": "The Victron MultiPlus-II is our top pick for lithium RV builds because it is fully configurable and integrates with the rest of a Victron system. It pairs a 3000VA pure sine inverter with a 120 amp charger, takes over loads within 20ms when shore or generator power drops, and its Power Assist feature tops up a weak shore or generator feed from the battery to prevent tripping a 30 amp pedestal.\n\nCompared with the Renogy REGO ranked next, the Victron costs more but gives finer control of charge voltages through Victron's configuration tools and pairs with Victron battery monitors and lithium systems. Against the Xantrex Freedom SW 3012, it is lighter and offers Power Assist, while Xantrex counters with a temperature sensor in the box and UL458 listing.\n\nThis suits owners building a serious lithium system who want it done properly.

    "explanation": "Charger amps determine how fast your bank refills from shore or a generator. Many lithium makers suggest staying around 0.2 to 0.5C, so a 200Ah bank charges comfortably at 40 to 100 amps. Check the maximum and adjustable range in the listing and compare it to your battery's recommended charge current."

  {
    "criterion": "Low-Temperature Charging Protection",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells should not be charged below about 32 degrees F unless the battery has internal heating. The inverter charger usually does not know cell temperature unless it has a sensor. Rely on a battery with low-temp charge cutoff, or a charger with a temperature sensor such as the one Xantrex includes."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer Time and Switch Rating",
    "explanation": "The transfer switch moves loads between shore and battery, and faster times like 10 to 20ms keep laptops and clocks from rebooting. The switch's amp rating must suit your panel. Check both the time and the transfer current rating in the listing."
