  "An inverter charger does two jobs in one box: it makes 120V AC from your battery, and when shore power or a generator is connected it charges the battery and passes that power to your outlets. The phrase is used loosely on shopping pages, so some products sold under it are really an inverter with a transfer switch, a charger only, or an inverter with no charging at all.",
  "We compared five products from $115.99 to $229.99 and sorted them by what the listing actually says they do. The question that decides this purchase is not watts, it is whether you need battery charging inside the same unit, which battery chemistry you charge, and what happens in the moment shore power drops. Where a listing is silent, we say so."

It has five working modes named Unattended, AC Priority, Battery Priority, ECO and Generator, works with 12V LiFePO4, lithium-ion, gel, AGM, SLA and flooded batteries, and is listed at under 60dB of noise. It includes a detachable controller with a 32.8ft remote cable and protections for overload, short circuit, over-temperature and AC and battery voltage.\n\nIt ranks first because it matches the product category and costs $53.54 less than the Renogy PUH and $63.54 less than the OLTEANP, both of which describe transfer switching but not battery charging. It is $50.46 more than the WOUDY, which charges only lead-acid chemistry. The listing excerpt does not give the charge current in amps, which makes the charger side harder to size than the WOUDY's stated 60A.\n\nPick it if you want one box that inverts and charges a lithium or AGM battery from shore power or a generator. The caveat is that charge amps, transfer time and warranty are missing from the listing, so find them in the manual before you buy for a large lithium bank.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Charger amps and profile",

A 60A charger refills 100Ah roughly twice as fast as a 30A charger, though lithium acceptance and temperature limit it. Look for the stated output current and the bulk and float voltages, and treat a listing that gives only a wattage as incomplete."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry compatibility",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid and LiFePO4 batteries need different charge voltages, and a profile chosen for one can undercharge or overcharge the other. A lead-acid profile at 14.4V bulk and 13.6V float may leave lithium partly charged. Look for LiFePO4 named explicitly or a selectable battery type setting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch speed and logic",
    "explanation": "A transfer switch moves your outlets from shore power to inverter power, and the time it takes decides whether a computer reboots. A 12ms switch is fast enough for most electronics, while a 20 to 30 second delay is designed for generator stabilization. Look for a stated millisecond figure or a UPS description, plus an option that sets which source has priority."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Inverter-only versus inverter-charger",
    "explanation": "Many listings use inverter charger loosely, so verify that charging is described. An inverter with a transfer switch passes power through but may not charge the batteries. Search the bullets for charge amps, charge stages or a mention of charging modes, and if none appear assume it does not charge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Full-load DC current and cable",
    "explanation": "A 12V inverter at 1200W pulls about 100A to 110A and at 2500W roughly 210A, including some conversion loss. That drives cable gauge, fuse size and battery capacity, and a lithium battery with a 100A limit can trip under it. Compare the current to your battery's continuous rating and use the cable size the manual lists."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certifications, noise and warranty",
    "explanation": "A listing that names UL, CE or FCC marks gives you something checkable, while generic claims of protection do not. Noise matters because an inverter charger is often installed in a bedroom closet or bay. Look for the standard names, a decibel number such as under 60dB, and a warranty length."

];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What is the difference between an inverter charger and an inverter?",
    "a": "An inverter makes AC from battery power. An inverter charger also charges the battery from shore power or a generator and typically passes AC through to your outlets. Some products only include a transfer switch, so confirm that charge amps are listed."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can an inverter charger replace my RV converter?",
    "a": "In some systems, yes, but it depends on wiring and what powers your DC loads. The converter also runs 12V lights and pumps. Ask an installer before removing the converter, and check the charger's amps against your battery bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the VEVOR 1200W worth it over the Renogy PUH?",
    "a": "If you need charging, yes. The VEVOR is $53.54 cheaper and describes battery charging, while the Renogy PUH describes switching and an app but not charging. If you already have a good converter charger, the Renogy PUH's app and certifications may suit you better."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set the charge profile for lithium?",
    "a": "Choose the LiFePO4 or lithium setting if the unit has one, and confirm the bulk and float voltages match the battery maker's numbers. Many LiFePO4 batteries want about 14.2V to 14.6V. If the unit has only lead-acid settings, use a separate lithium-compatible charger."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a transfer switch with an inverter?",
    "a": "If the inverter feeds your RV's wall outlets, yes, to prevent backfeeding shore power. A plug-in inverter that powers only its own outlets does not need one. Hardwiring should be done by a qualified person."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my inverter charger hum or run its fan on shore power?",
    "a": "Charging at high current produces heat, so fans run and transformer-based units hum. If it never stops, check ventilation, charge current and battery state, and read the manual for noise figures."
