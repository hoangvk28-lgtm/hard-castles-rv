  "An RV air conditioner is the hardest load an inverter will see. A 13,500 BTU rooftop unit often runs near 1,400 to 1,800 watts and its compressor can briefly pull several times that at startup unless it has a soft start. On the DC side, 2,000 watts means 170 amps or more at 12V. We picked three pure sine inverters with different strengths, and explain which one pairs with a soft start AC and which would need a larger battery bank or a higher voltage system."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "AC running and startup watts",
    "explanation": "The AC nameplate lists running amps, and multiplying by 120V gives running watts. A compressor can briefly draw 3 to 5 times that at startup unless soft started. Look at the nameplate, not the BTU number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DC amps at the battery",
    "explanation": "At 12V, 2,000W needs roughly 170 to 185 amps and 2,500W over 210. Lower voltage battery sags and cables heat. Check that your battery BMS and cable gauge can carry it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge duration",
    "explanation": "A surge rating is only useful for its duration: AIMS lists 6,000W for up to 20 seconds, while others list peak power without a time. Compressors need time to ramp. Look for a stated duration."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch and pass-through",
    "explanation": "A transfer switch moves your loads between shore power and inverter automatically. EGSCATEE lists about 12 ms and AIMS includes one. Without it, you must switch manually."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hardwire versus plug-in",
    "explanation": "AC loads run through breakers, and an AC wired to the panel needs a hardwired inverter. EGSCATEE has a terminal block. Check that the listing mentions terminals, not just outlets."

  },
  {
    "q": "How long will a battery bank run an AC?",
