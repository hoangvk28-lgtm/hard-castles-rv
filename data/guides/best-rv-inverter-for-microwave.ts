  "Running a microwave from a 12V RV battery is a sizing problem before it is a product problem. A microwave labeled 1,000 watts of cooking power often pulls 1,400 to 1,700 watts from the inverter, and at 12V that is well over 125 amps from the battery. We narrowed the field to two pure sine wave inverters that can carry that load: a 1,500W unit for compact microwaves and a 4,000W unit for larger ones, and explain the battery, cable and duty cycle limits that decide which one fits."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Microwave input versus output",
    "explanation": "A microwave advertises output watts, but the inverter must supply input watts, often 40% higher. A 1,000W microwave may draw 1,400 to 1,700W. Check the label inside the door for input power, not the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery amps at 12V",
    "explanation": "Divide inverter watts by 12 and add about 10% for losses. A 1,500W load draws roughly 140 amps, which requires thick cable and a bank rated for that current. Check your battery BMS rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine wave output",
    "explanation": "Pure sine wave inverters produce clean power that microwave electronics and inverter style microwaves expect. Modified sine can cause buzzing or heat. Both Voltworks 1500W and Sunwheel 4000W list pure sine."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge duration",
    "explanation": "Voltworks lists 3,100W surge for only 2 seconds and Sunwheel lists 8,000W peak at startup. Microwaves have a modest startup, but a short surge on a tight inverter can trip it. Look for the time listed with the surge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cables and fusing",
    "explanation": "The cables you use determine voltage drop and safety. Sunwheel includes 4 cables and 6 fuses, but does not list gauge. Match gauge to a 125A to 140A draw."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 1500W inverter run a 1000W microwave?",
    "a": "Usually yes, since the input is often 1,400 to 1,700W. A 1,000W microwave with 1,400W input is within range, but a 1,700W input is not."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a pure sine wave inverter for a microwave?",
    "a": "It is the safer choice, especially for inverter style microwaves. Both picks here are pure sine."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long can I run a microwave on one battery?",
    "a": "A 2 minute reheat uses roughly 50 to 60Wh, so a 1,280Wh lithium battery can handle many reheats."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a remote switch useful?",
    "a": "Yes, it lets you shut the inverter off to avoid idle draw. Voltworks 1500W includes a 15 ft remote."
