  "A refrigerator is a different load from a microwave. It is small while running but never really off: the compressor cycles on and off all day, spikes briefly at startup, and runs for hours in total. That makes idle draw and overnight battery drain the real cost of the inverter, not its peak rating. The three pure sine picks below all have the surge headroom a compressor needs, so the choice comes down to how much spare capacity you want and what you pay for it."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Startup surge versus running",
    "explanation": "A compressor draws a short spike at start, often several times its running watts, then settles. If the inverter cannot supply the spike, it trips. Check the fridge nameplate for running watts and use the listed surge on the inverter, aiming for twice the nameplate figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Duty cycle and daily energy",
    "explanation": "Fridges run roughly a third to half the time depending on heat. A 150W fridge at a 40 percent duty cycle uses about 1440Wh a day. Divide by battery voltage to see amp-hours, and read the fridge label for watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Idle draw at night",
    "explanation": "An inverter stays on and draws current even when the fridge is off. Over 12 hours that can cost 10 to 30 amp-hours. Look for a no-load figure on the spec sheet, which these listings do not state."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine for compressors",
    "explanation": "Compressor motors run cooler on pure sine and stay quieter. Modified sine can hum or shorten motor life. All three picks list pure sine in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable and fuse size",
    "explanation": "Even a small load needs the surge current delivered. A 3000W unit can pull 250 amps at full load, so fuse near the battery and keep cables short. Check the listing for recommended wire gauge."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can a 2000W inverter run a refrigerator?",
    "a": "Yes for nearly all RV and household fridges, since compressor starts rarely exceed 1000W. The ZETAWALE 2000W has plenty of margin."
  },
  {
    "q": "How many amp-hours does a fridge use overnight?",
    "a": "A typical 120V fridge uses 50 to 100 amp-hours at 12V over a night, depending on size. Check the nameplate and your ambient heat."
  },
  {
    "q": "Should I turn the inverter off at night?",
    "a": "Not if the fridge needs power. A small unit idles less than a large one, which favors the 2000W."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does the ALLWEI 3000W list its idle draw?",
    "a": "The excerpt does not, so check the manual or measure at the battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is pure sine really needed for a fridge?",
