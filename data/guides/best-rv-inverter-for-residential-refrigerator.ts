  "Swapping the RV absorption fridge for a residential model saves money and adds space, but it changes your power plan. A residential compressor fridge has a larger startup spike than a compact RV unit, and many have electronic controls that dislike rough waveforms. So sizing here starts with surge, waveform and the voltage of your bank. The three picks below cover a standard 12V system, a 48V solar bank and a bare-minimum budget option with real caveats."

At $199.99 it has the capacity to start a full-size residential fridge compressor and clean waveform for the electronics.\n\nIt costs $30.00 less than the ZETAWALE 48V and $144.01 more than the YSOLX 1000W. The cleaner output and larger rating are why it ranks first for most coaches. Pick this if you have a 12V bank and a 18 to 25 cubic foot fridge.
