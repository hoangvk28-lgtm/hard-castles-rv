  "An RV solar system lives or dies on voltage and current compatibility, not on the panel wattage printed on the box. A hybrid inverter with a built-in solar charge controller can save you a separate component, but only if its PV input voltage and charge current match your array and your battery bank. These four picks include two 24V hybrids, a 12V inverter charger and a plain 12V inverter. Each section says what daily energy to expect so the sizing is grounded in reality."
