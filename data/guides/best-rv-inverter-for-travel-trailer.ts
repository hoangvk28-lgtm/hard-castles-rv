  "Travel trailers are the tightest installs in RV life. The battery usually sits on the tongue, the inverter has to fit in a small front compartment or under a bed, and most trailers have 30 amp shore service with a 12V converter already built in. That changes what a good inverter looks like: modest wattage, short cable runs and no need for its own charger. These three picks stay small and honest about what they can run."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Fit in a tongue box",
    "explanation": "Inverters need airflow and clear access to terminals. A 10 by 4 inch body fits most tongue boxes. Measure your space and read dimensions on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery size for the load",
    "explanation": "A single 100Ah battery supports roughly 800W for about an hour. Heavy loads drain batteries quickly. Divide watt-hours needed by battery voltage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length",
    "explanation": "Cable length matters because resistance turns into voltage drop, and at 12V even a small drop can trip an inverter's low voltage alarm. A run from a tongue battery to a rear cabinet can be 15 feet or more. Keep inverter cables as short as practical, size them to the amp draw, and use the cable gauge chart in the manual."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waveform",
    "explanation": "Waveform describes how smooth the AC power is. Pure sine wave matches household outlets, while modified sine is a stepped approximation that can make CPAPs, laptop chargers and small motors hum, run hot or fail early. Check the listing title for the words pure sine wave, and treat unlisted waveforms as modified sine until proven otherwise."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Converter charger separate",
    "explanation": "Most travel trailers already have a built-in 12V converter charger that charges the battery from shore power, so paying for a second charger inside an inverter charger is wasted money. A stand-alone inverter only converts battery power to AC. Check your trailer's converter amp rating in the manual, and only buy a combo unit if you plan to replace it."
