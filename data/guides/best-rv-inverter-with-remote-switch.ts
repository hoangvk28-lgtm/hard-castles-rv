  "A remote switch matters because most RV inverters live in a battery bay or under a bed, and leaving one idling can waste several watts all night. We chose two inverters that include a remote and one add-on remote for owners who already have a compatible inverter. The key question is compatibility: remote ports are brand specific, so a remote that fits one inverter can be useless on another. We spell out which pick suits which situation."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Remote port compatibility",
    "explanation": "Remote ports are usually brand specific, and the RJ10 plug on Voltworks gear will not necessarily fit another brand. Plugging the wrong remote can do nothing or damage the circuit. Check the listing for supported models."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote cable length",
    "explanation": "Cable length decides where you can mount the switch. Voltworks 1500W lists 15 ft and the Voltworks Remote lists 30 ft. A listing that does not state length, like EGSCATEE, needs a check before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Idle draw when off",
    "explanation": "An inverter that is on with no load still draws power, often 10 to 40 watts, which empties a battery over a day. A remote makes shutting it off easy. Check whether the listing states idle draw; most here do not."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hardwire versus outlets",
    "explanation": "Plug in inverters power one or two outlets, while hardwired ones feed the RV panel. A hardwired unit needs a terminal block, which EGSCATEE lists. Match the type to your wiring."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Transfer switch",

    "a": "The listing excerpt does not state it. Ask the seller before planning the mounting spot."
