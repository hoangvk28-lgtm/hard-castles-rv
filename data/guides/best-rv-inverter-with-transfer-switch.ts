  "An inverter with a built-in transfer switch lets your RV outlets pass shore power straight through when you are plugged in, then flip to battery power the moment the pedestal or generator drops. Without one, you either rewire outlets by hand or add a separate transfer switch box. The important details are often buried: how fast the switch moves loads, how many amps it can pass through, and whether there is a hardwired AC input terminal for an RV panel.",
  "The field of true transfer-switch inverters is smaller than the general inverter market, so this list has five picks rather than seven. Each one has a documented automatic transfer switch, and we compared switch speed, wiring options, and output from a 1500W budget unit to a 3000W model with app monitoring."

Its on-grid transfer switch moves loads between shore AC and battery DC automatically, it runs above 92 percent efficiency with under 18W idle consumption, includes built-in Bluetooth and a wired remote switch, and its fans stay under 51dB.\n\nAgainst the AIMS 2000W ranked next, Renogy offers more inverter output and app monitoring but does not include a battery charger, so you keep your existing converter. AIMS combines inverter, charger, and switch, which suits rigs replacing a converter. Against the LiTime 2000W below, the Renogy adds 1000W and Bluetooth.\n\nThis suits owners with a working lithium-ready converter who want to add 3000W AC and seamless switching.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Automatic, Not Manual Switching",
    "explanation": "An automatic transfer switch senses shore power and moves loads between shore and battery without you touching anything. Some inverters only offer a bypass or require plugging appliances into the inverter directly. Look for ATS, automatic transfer switch, or UPS in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pass-Through Current Rating",
    "explanation": "When shore power is connected, current for your outlets flows through the inverter's switch, which has its own amp limit. If the limit is lower than your circuits draw, it can trip or overheat. Check the transfer or bypass current rating in the manual before wiring it to a subpanel."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Avoid Backfeeding the Converter",
    "explanation": "If the inverter powers outlets that include your converter's circuit, the converter will try to charge the batteries from the inverter, wasting energy. This is a common install mistake. Wire the inverter to a subpanel that excludes the converter breaker."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hardwired AC Input",
    "explanation": "A hardwired terminal block lets you connect the inverter permanently to the RV's panel, which is safer and cleaner than plug-in cords. Outlet-only units suit portable setups. Check for an AC input terminal block in the listing photos or description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Switch Time for Sensitive Loads",
    "explanation": "Switch times around 10 to 20ms are fast enough for most electronics, while slower switching can reboot computers or CPAP machines. Check the quoted time; the 1500W unit here lists 12ms and LiTime lists 20ms."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable Size and Fusing",
    "explanation": "A 2000W inverter can draw over 150 amps from a 12V battery, so cables must be heavy and fused close to the battery. Undersized cables cause voltage drop and heat. Check whether cables are included and what gauge the manual recommends."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I still need my RV's transfer switch with one of these?",
    "a": "Your RV's main transfer switch picks between shore and generator, while the inverter's switch picks between that incoming AC and the battery. They can coexist if the inverter feeds a subpanel downstream of the main switch. Avoid wiring both to the same circuits."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake causes most inverter transfer switch problems?",
    "a": "Including the converter on the inverter-fed circuits, which creates a loop where the converter charges batteries from the inverter. Keep the converter on a circuit that only receives shore or generator power."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is an inverter charger worth it over an inverter with transfer switch?",
    "a": "If your converter is old or lacks a lithium profile, yes, because an inverter charger like the AIMS replaces it. If your converter already charges lithium properly, an inverter only like the Renogy PUH saves money."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install an inverter with a transfer switch in an RV?",
    "a": "Mount it close to the batteries, run heavy fused cables, connect AC input from a shore power breaker, and send AC output to a subpanel with the circuits you want on battery. Many owners use a licensed electrician or RV tech for the AC side."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does my inverter beep when I unplug shore power?",
    "a": "That is usually the transfer switch confirming it moved to battery. If it beeps repeatedly, check for low battery voltage, overloaded circuits, or overheating, and consult the error codes on the display or remote."
