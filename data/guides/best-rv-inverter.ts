  "An RV inverter turns 12V battery power into 120V AC so a laptop, TV, CPAP or phone charger works without a plug-in hookup. The size you pick matters less than most shoppers assume. A 1000W unit and a 3000W unit both run a TV, but the larger one demands roughly three times the battery current, thicker cable and a bigger fuse before it does anything useful.",
  "This hub compares five inverters from $41.99 to $149.99 and treats each as a purchase decision, not a spec race. For every pick we say who should buy it and who should skip it, and we flag what the listing leaves unstated. If you already know your wattage, the 1000W, 1500W, 3000W and 4000W guides on this site go deeper, and the inverter charger guide covers units that also charge your batteries."

At $99.99 it is the second cheapest pick here.\n\nIt ranks first because it covers the loads most travelers actually run, and it is $10 cheaper than the ALLWEI 1000W while including a remote and cables. It does less than the TOPBULL 3000W, which costs $50 more, but it also asks for far less from your battery. Next to the $41.99 BESTEK 300W it adds roughly 700W more continuous output for $58 more.\n\nPick it if you want one inverter for a TV, laptops, CPAP and chargers and you have a single 12V battery or a small bank. The caveat is that nothing in the listing mentions a transfer switch, a GFCI outlet or a warranty length, so look at the manual before you rely on it for anything beyond plug-in loads.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Pure sine versus modified sine",
    "explanation": "Pure sine wave output is a smooth curve like utility power, while modified sine is a stepped approximation. Sensitive loads such as CPAP machines, laptop supplies and variable speed motors can run hot, buzz or fault on the stepped wave. Look for the words pure sine in the title or first bullet, and treat a listing that never says either as unconfirmed."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous watts, not surge",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts is what the inverter can supply indefinitely, while surge is a brief peak for startup that may last only a few seconds. A 1000W unit with 2000W surge cannot run a 1500W load, even for a short while. Check that your largest running load sits under the continuous figure with about 20 percent to spare."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "DC current and cable size",
    "explanation": "The inverter pulls its energy from the battery at 12V, so every 1000W of output needs roughly 83A, plus losses, from the battery. Thin cable overheats and drops voltage, which can trip a low-voltage shutdown. Match the included cable gauge to the inverter's size, and the listing's 7AWG for 1000W is a useful reference point."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery BMS current limit",
    "explanation": "A lithium battery's battery management system caps how many amps it can deliver, often 100A or 200A. A 3000W load needs about 250A or more, so a single 100Ah battery will shut down under it. Compare the inverter's full-load amps to the BMS continuous rating on the battery listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Remote, display and mounting",
    "explanation": "An inverter is usually mounted near the battery, often in a bay or cabinet where you cannot see it. A remote with a screen lets you shut it down and read voltage from inside the RV. Look for the remote cable length or wireless range, and confirm the display shows input voltage and load, not only a power light."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Documented protections and standards",
    "explanation": "Low-voltage, overload, over-temperature and reverse polarity protection prevent a mistake from becoming a fire or a dead battery. A named standard such as UL 458 is stronger evidence than a list of marketing terms. Search the listing for standards and a warranty length, and treat their absence as a question to ask the seller."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What size RV inverter do I need?",
    "a": "Add the running watts of everything you plan to use at once, then add about 20 percent. A laptop, TV and phone chargers usually fit under 500W, while a coffee maker or hair dryer needs 1000W or more. If you want to run an air conditioner, step up to a 3000W class unit with a large lithium bank."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I plug an RV inverter directly into the battery with the included cables?",
    "a": "Yes for small units, but add a fuse close to the positive terminal sized to the cable and inverter. Keep cables short and tight, and check the manufacturer's instructions for torque. A loose connection is the most common cause of heat and voltage drop."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a 3000W inverter worth it over a 1000W model?",
    "a": "Only if you actually need the extra output. The TOPBULL 3000W costs $50 more than the LANDERPOW 1000W and demands roughly three times the battery current. Most travelers who only run electronics are better served by the 1000W pure sine units."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect an inverter to my RV outlets?",
    "a": "Plug-in inverters power only the outlets on the unit itself. Powering the RV's wall outlets needs a hardwire connection with a transfer switch to avoid backfeeding shore power or a generator, which is a job for a qualified installer."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does an inverter drain the battery when nothing is plugged in?",
    "a": "Yes, a small amount. Every inverter has a no-load draw that varies by model and is often not listed. Turn the unit off with the remote when you are not using it, especially when running from a small battery."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a pure sine wave inverter for a CPAP?",
    "a": "Most CPAP makers recommend pure sine, and a modified sine wave can cause noise or faults. Check your machine's manual, and use a pure sine unit like the LANDERPOW 1000W or ALLWEI 1000W with enough watts for a heated humidifier."
