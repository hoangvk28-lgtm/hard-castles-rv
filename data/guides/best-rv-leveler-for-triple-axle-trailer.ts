export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Ramp length vs tire spacing",
    "explanation": "Triple axle tires sit close together, so a long ramp can touch the next tire. A compact length designed for tandem wheels clears them. Look for tandem or compact wording in the listing, and measure your gap if possible."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum lift height",
    "explanation": "Lift height is how much the ramp raises a tire, and curved levelers here reach 4 inches. If your site slopes more than that, you need blocks too. Check the stated lift against how far out of level you usually are."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Increment control",
    "explanation": "Some levelers step in fixed increments while others let you stop anywhere. The OULEME lists any increment between 1/2 and 4 inches. Look for the increment size to avoid overshooting."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chocks included",
    "explanation": "A chock holds the opposite tire so the trailer cannot roll off the ramp. Camco includes rubber-gripped chocks. Check whether the listing includes them, since buying separately adds cost."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight rating per tire",
    "explanation": "A triple axle trailer is heavy, so ramps must carry load per tire. The OULEME lists tires up to 35,000 pounds. Check the stated rating and compare it with your trailer's gross weight."

  },
  {
    "q": "How many levelers do I need?",
    "a": "One per side is the minimum, and a pair is usually enough. Check your trailer's weight rating against the ramp rating."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Camco worth it over the OULEME?",
    "a": "Camco includes chocks and a brand name, while OULEME offers finer steps at a lower price. Choose based on which feature you need."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I use a curved leveler?",
    "a": "Place the ramp in front of the tire, drive up slowly, and set the chock. Use a spotter and check the level before settling."
