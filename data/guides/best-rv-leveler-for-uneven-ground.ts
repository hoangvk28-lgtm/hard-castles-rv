export const buyingCriteria = [

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Load capacity",
    "explanation": "Capacity is the weight each ramp or block can carry. The MaxxHaul lists 3,250 pounds per ramp. Check the stated number against the weight on your heaviest tire."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Anti-slip features",
    "explanation": "On loose dirt or gravel a smooth ramp can shift. Gear mesh designs and rubber mats give grip. Look for the anti-slip details in the listing."
  },

    "criterion": "Increment control",
    "explanation": "Fixed steps are simple, while gear mesh ramps stop anywhere. Fine control reduces overshoot. Check how many positions the leveler offers."
