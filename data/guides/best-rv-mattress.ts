export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Exact size label",
    "explanation": "RV sizes such as short queen, RV queen and short king are not standard, and a 60 by 75 inch short queen differs from a 60 by 80 inch queen. Buying the wrong label means a bed that does not fit. Measure your platform and compare it to the listed dimensions."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thickness and slide clearance",
    "explanation": "A 12 inch bed can block a bunk slide or raise the sleeper close to a ceiling. Thinner 8 inch beds are easier to fit. Measure the clearance above the platform before choosing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Hybrid versus foam",
    "explanation": "Hybrid beds use coils for support and airflow, while foam beds contour closely and weigh less. Coils add weight, which matters for a moving rig. Check the listing to see whether coils are included."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cooling and cover",
    "explanation": "Cooling gel, graphene or breathable covers help in a small, warm space. They influence temperature more than firmness. Look for a named cooling feature rather than a generic claim."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certifications and warranty",

  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use a regular queen in my RV?",
    "a": "Not usually. A regular queen is longer, so it may not fit in the bedroom or slide. Measure first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long does a boxed mattress take to expand?",
    "a": "Many state 24 to 72 hours to fully expand after unboxing, so do it before your first trip."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need a mattress topper too?",
    "a": "Usually not. If a bed feels firm, a thin topper can help, but check that the extra height clears your slide."
