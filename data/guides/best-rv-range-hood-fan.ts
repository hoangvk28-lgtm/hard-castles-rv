  "Cooking in a small coach fills the cabin with steam, grease and odors fast, and a real range hood is the cleanest way to deal with it. Most search results for this topic turn out to be replacement motors and roof vent fans, which are not range hoods at all. This guide keeps to a genuine 12V RV range hood and explains how to judge any hood before you buy."

    "description": "The Greystone is a 22 inch super slim, vented range hood that runs on 12V, so it works from the coach battery system. It moves about 200 cubic meters of air per hour through a dual-speed fan and includes a built-in 12V LED lamp over the cooktop.\n\nA three-layer charcoal filter helps with odors, and the slim profile keeps headroom in a compact kitchen. It suits owners replacing or adding a cooktop hood in a travel trailer, camper van or small motorhome.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Vented versus recirculating",
    "explanation": "A vented hood exhausts air outside while a recirculating one filters and returns it. Venting removes steam and grease better, but needs a duct path. Check the listing for the word vented."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Airflow rating",
    "explanation": "Airflow is shown in cubic meters per hour or CFM. A tiny kitchen needs far less than a house, but too little leaves odors behind. Compare the stated figure with your cooktop size."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Width and depth",
    "explanation": "A hood must fit under cabinets without hitting your head. Measure width, depth and mounting height. The Greystone is 22 inches wide."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "12V operation",
    "explanation": "RV hoods typically run on 12V so they work off-grid. A 120V motor would need an inverter. Look for 12V in the title."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Filter type",
    "explanation": "Charcoal filters absorb odors and need replacing over time. Metal mesh filters can be washed. Check which type is included."

    "q": "Do I need to vent it outside?",
    "a": "This hood is listed as vented, so plan a duct path."
  },
  {
    "q": "How often do I change the filter?",
    "a": "Charcoal filters lose effectiveness over time, so replace them as odors return."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I run it off the house battery?",
    "a": "Yes, it is a 12V unit, though check the draw against your battery bank."
