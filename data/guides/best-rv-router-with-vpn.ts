export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "VPN protocols supported",
    "explanation": "WireGuard is lighter and faster than OpenVPN on small hardware. The router must support the protocol your VPN service uses. Look for named protocols and provider counts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated VPN throughput",
    "explanation": "A router CPU limits how fast encrypted traffic moves. A figure like 28 Mbps OpenVPN is slow for streaming. Look for VPN speed numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "How it gets internet",
    "explanation": "A router needs an internet source, and that source decides where you can use it. Travel routers use campground Wi-Fi, tethering or Ethernet, while cellular routers carry a SIM and modem. Look for WISP, tethering or a SIM slot in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wi-Fi standard",
    "explanation": "The Wi-Fi standard sets how many devices share the airwaves smoothly. Wi-Fi 6 handles crowded networks better than Wi-Fi 5, which matters with phones, TVs and laptops running at once. Look for AX in the product name for Wi-Fi 6."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Security extras",

  {
    "q": "Is the Slate AX worth it over the A1300?",
    "a": "Slate AX adds Wi-Fi 6 and WireGuard up to 550 Mbps, while the A1300 is cheaper. Choose by your internet speed."
  },
