export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Wi-Fi as WAN",
    "explanation": "The router joins a network for internet. WAN is the connection that brings internet into the router, and it can be Ethernet, a Wi-Fi network you join, a USB phone tether or a cellular modem. Routers that list several WAN modes can fail over when one drops. Check which input modes the listing names, since a router without Wi-Fi-as-WAN cannot join campground Wi-Fi."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Speed class",
    "explanation": "Wi-Fi class sets speed. Wi-Fi band decides range and speed: 2.4 GHz travels farther through walls and trees, while 5 GHz is faster at short distance. A dual-band product lets you use both, and listed speed totals are lab maximums rather than what a campground link delivers. Look for the band names and treat the headline Mbps figure as a ceiling."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "VPN",
    "explanation": "VPN protects traffic. Travel routers that create a private network behind a campground connection help keep your devices off shared Wi-Fi. VPN support such as OpenVPN or WireGuard adds another layer on public networks. Look for the VPN names and firmware notes on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ports",
    "explanation": "Ports help wired devices. Ethernet ports let you wire a smart TV or a laptop for better stability than Wi-Fi. Gigabit and 2.5 Gbps ports exceed what most campground links deliver but help with local transfers. Check the port speeds and how many are WAN versus LAN."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Power",
    "explanation": "USB power decides where it works. Power source matters in a rig: USB-C or micro USB devices run from a battery bank, 12V units wire to the coach, and PoE units need an injector or switch. A product that needs 110V is dead on a dry-camping night. Look for the input voltage or connector in the spec line and plan the cable run."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What does Wi-Fi as WAN mean?",
    "a": "The router joins a Wi-Fi network for internet and shares it privately. It is also called client or hotspot mode."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make?",
    "a": "Expecting the router to boost the Wi-Fi signal. It only joins it, so poor campground signal stays poor."
  },

    "q": "Is the Roam 6 AX3000 worth it over the Opal?",
    "a": "It adds Wi-Fi 6 and a 2.5G port. The Opal costs less."

    "q": "How do I set up Wi-Fi as WAN?",
    "a": "Choose hotspot or repeater mode in the admin page. Scan for networks and join the one you want."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I maintain it?",
