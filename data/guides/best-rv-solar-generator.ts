  "A solar generator is a battery with an inverter and panels, so it has no engine, no fuel and no noise, but it also has a finite capacity. A 1,000 Wh unit runs a 12V fridge for a day or two, but a 13,500 BTU AC would drain it in about an hour. A 200W panel yields at most about 1,000 Wh on a perfect day and closer to 600 to 800 Wh in practice. Size capacity first, then panels."

  {
    "criterion": "Capacity in watt-hours",
    "explanation": "Watt-hours is how much energy is stored, unlike watts, which is how fast it can be used. A 1,000Wh unit runs a 100W load for about 10 hours. Check Wh, not mAh, on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Daily solar harvest",
    "explanation": "A 200W panel produces at most about 1,000Wh on a perfect 5-sun-hour day and typically 600 to 800Wh. That does not recharge a 2,000Wh unit in a day. Check how many panels ship in the box."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Continuous vs surge watts",
    "explanation": "Continuous watts is what the inverter holds, surge is a brief spike. An RV AC may need over 3,000W to start. Compare the surge number to your biggest appliance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Voltage and input range",
    "explanation": "Solar input has a voltage window, and a series-wired panel pair can exceed it. Mismatch means the unit charges slowly or not at all. Check the max input volts and watts on the spec sheet."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry and cycles",
    "explanation": "LFP batteries last 3,000 to 4,000 cycles versus about 800 for older lithium types. That is years of daily use. Look for LFP or LiFePO4 in the listing."
