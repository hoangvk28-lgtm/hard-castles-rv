  "A solar panel kit looks simple: panels, a controller and some cable. The decisions hiding inside it are the ones that matter. A PWM controller wastes a share of what MPPT would harvest, a kit without brackets or battery cables sends you shopping again, and a 400W label can mean four small panels or two large ones, which changes how they fit on a roof and how they behave in shade.",
  "We compared six kits from $126.34 to $549.99 on what each listing states: panel count and size, controller type and amp rating, included cables and brackets, monitoring and warranty. One is a 100W PWM starter, and five are 400W MPPT kits whose prices span $329.99 to $549.99, a $220 range for the same nameplate wattage. The sections below explain what that gap buys and what it does not."

What you give up is in the listing's silence: it does not mention brackets, cables, a Bluetooth module or a display, so you should expect to buy mounts, a battery cable set and fuses. A 30A controller on a 12V battery also tops out near 420W, so a 400W array fits but leaves almost no room to add panels later.\n\nPick this if you are comfortable sourcing brackets and cable and want the least expensive route to 400W.

    "criterion": "Cable gauge and length",
    "explanation": "Thin or long cable wastes power as heat, and the loss grows with current. The ExpertPower 400W lists 12AWG solar and battery cables, and the ACOPOWER 400W lists a 30 foot 10AWG set. Measure the path from roof to controller to battery, and make sure the supplied cable reaches with room to spare."

  {
    "criterion": "Real daily energy",
    "explanation": "A kit's quoted kilowatt-hours assume ideal sun. A simple estimate is array watts times sun hours times about 0.75, so 400W at 5 sun hours is roughly 1,500Wh, below the 2 to 2.5kWh some listings claim. Use your region's sun hours in your own estimate and size your battery and loads to that number."

    "q": "Are 400W kits compatible with a 12V RV battery?",
    "a": "Yes, the listed 400W kits are 12V-class systems. The ECO 400W Bluetooth, ExpertPower 400W and ACOPOWER 400W controllers also handle 24V, and the Renogy 400W Premium lists a 32V maximum battery voltage. Match the controller to your battery voltage and confirm the panel wiring is parallel for 12V."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake buyers make with solar kits?",
    "a": "Counting only the nameplate watts. A 400W array rarely delivers 400W, and a missing bracket or thin cable can cost more than the kit saved. Estimate energy at 0.75 of watts times sun hours and price the missing hardware before you buy."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the ACOPOWER 400W worth $220 more than the 2x200 Kit?",
    "a": "Only if you need what it adds: 30 feet of 10AWG cable, brackets, an LCD controller and four smaller panels. For a clear roof and a controller near the battery, the cheaper 2x200 Kit delivers the same 400W."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I wire four 100W panels to a 12V controller?",
    "a": "Connect all four in parallel with Y branch connectors, which keeps array voltage near 18V and current near 22A, which fits a 40A controller. Wiring in series gives about 72V and needs a controller that accepts it. Check the controller's maximum input voltage first."
  },
  {
    "q": "How often should I check a solar kit?",
    "a": "Look over connectors, brackets and sealant twice a year, rinse the panels when dirty and check controller readings against expectations. A sudden drop in output usually means shade, dirt or a loose connector."
