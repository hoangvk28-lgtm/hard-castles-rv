  "A tilted panel can collect noticeably more energy than a flat one, especially in winter or when parked facing the wrong way. Tilt brackets let you chase the sun, but only if they hold their angle in wind. This guide compares two 30W kits, both with controllers included, and explains who benefits from tilting and when a bigger fixed panel beats them."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Tilt angle for your latitude",
    "explanation": "A common rule is to tilt toward the sun by roughly your latitude, steeper in winter. Fixed flat panels lose output at low sun. Check the bracket's stated range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bracket holding strength",
    "explanation": "A bracket that slips in wind wastes the benefit of tilting and can drop the panel. Ball joints and locking screws matter. Check the listing for the lock style."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "MPPT versus PWM",
    "explanation": "MPPT extracts more power in cool, low light, while PWM is simpler and cheaper. The difference is most visible in winter. Check whether the listing names the controller type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Wattage ceiling",
    "explanation": "A 30W panel makes only about 100 to 150Wh a day. That runs lights and a fan, not a fridge. Compare that figure with your daily use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cable length",
    "explanation": "Short cables force the panel near the battery, while long runs lose voltage. Thin cable at 10A loses more. Check the cable length and gauge in the listing."

    "a": "Yes for maintaining a battery in winter, no for replacing a roof array. The gain is greatest at low sun angles."

  {
    "q": "Can I mount these permanently?",
    "a": "They have pre-set mounting holes, but check the brackets for roof use. Seal any drilled holes."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does the Hoysicy use MPPT?",
    "a": "The listing does not say, so assume a simpler controller. Compare with the Voltset if efficiency matters."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long do 30W kits last?",
    "a": "The listings do not state warranty, so confirm with the seller. Weather sealing is IP65 on the Hoysicy."
