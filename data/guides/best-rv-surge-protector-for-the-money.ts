  "Shopping for value in RV surge protectors gets confusing fast, because the cheapest listings often advertise the biggest joule numbers. A $30 box claiming 26,000 joules is not ten times better than a $140 unit rated at 3,000; established brands rate their parts conservatively, while budget sellers rarely say how the figure was derived. Real value comes from what the unit does when power goes bad, how long it is covered, and whether it matches your rig's plug.",
  "So this list ranks protectors on protection delivered per dollar. We separated units that actually disconnect power from those that only show diagnostic lights, weighed warranty length and certifications, and included a 50 amp option because a cheap mismatch is the costliest mistake of all."

It disconnects when voltage falls below 103 volts or rises above 132 volts, reconnects once voltage recovers, checks for open ground, open neutral, reverse polarity, and hot-ground reversal before you connect, and carries a five-year warranty.\n\nCompared with the Progressive SSP-30XL ranked next, GEARGO adds automatic disconnect (the Progressive only warns), a longer warranty, and an IP68 cover at a slightly lower price. The Progressive keeps the edge on brand track record and published engineering. Against the $30 picks lower down, it costs about $17 more but adds a warranty five times as long as typical budget coverage.\n\nChoose it if you want genuine low-voltage shutoff without paying EMS prices. The caveat is that the 15,000 joule figure is not benchmarked like Progressive ratings, so do not read it as true lightning-strike protection.",

It is rated 30 amps at 120 volts, absorbs up to 825 joules, and warns against over and under voltage, open ground and neutral, reverse polarity, surge failure, and AC frequency issues, all in a Lexan housing with a weather shield and thermal protection.\n\nAgainst the GEARGO above it, the SSP-30XL warns rather than disconnects for voltage problems, so you still have to act when it flags low voltage. Its strength is a surge failure indicator that tells you when the protection is spent, which budget units rarely offer. Stepping up to the Power Watchdog PWD30 adds Bluetooth monitoring and 3,000 joules for nearly three times the price.\n\nThis suits owners who trust brand engineering and are happy to read the indicators before plugging in.

In exchange, it has an unusually detailed wiring fault readout and a well-made right-angle plug that resists bending at the pedestal.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Shutoff Is Worth More Than Joules",
    "explanation": "Joules measure how much spike energy a protector can absorb before its parts wear out, but they do nothing about low voltage. Low voltage on a hot day is what slowly damages AC compressors and converters. On a listing, prioritize auto shutoff or auto disconnect with stated voltage limits over the biggest joule figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Read Budget Joule Claims Skeptically",
    "explanation": "Established brands rate surge components conservatively, which is why a Power Watchdog shows 3,000 joules while unknown brands claim 15,000 to 26,000. There is no common test behind most budget claims. Compare brands within the same tier rather than across tiers, and look for ETL or UL listings as a better quality signal."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty Length as a Value Signal",
    "explanation": "Surge protectors live outdoors in rain and sun, so housing and cable failures are common after a few seasons. A longer warranty spreads the cost over more trips. Check the listing for an exact term like the GEARGO five-year coverage; if none is stated, assume a short one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Match 30 or 50 Amp Correctly",
    "explanation": "A 30 amp RV uses a three-prong TT-30 plug on one 120 volt leg, while a 50 amp RV uses a four-prong 14-50 plug with two legs. Using the wrong protector with an adapter either limits your power or leaves a leg unmonitored. Confirm the plug type on your RV cord before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Surge Failure Indicator",
    "explanation": "Surge components are sacrificial, and once spent the unit may still pass power with no protection left. A surge failure indicator tells you when that happens. Look for surge failure in the feature list, as Progressive includes, since cheaper units often fail silently."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Display and Diagnostics",
    "explanation": "A voltage readout lets you see a sagging pedestal before it causes trouble, while LEDs alone only show wiring faults. Diagnostics that name a fault save guessing at night. Check whether the listing shows a numeric voltage display or only indicator lights."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Can I use a 30 amp surge protector on a 50 amp RV?",
    "a": "Only through an adapter, and you will be limited to 30 amps with one leg protected. For a 50 amp rig, buy a 50 amp unit such as the TGJOR so both legs are monitored and you keep your full power."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do budget buyers make most?",
    "a": "Buying on joule rating alone. A big joule number does nothing about low voltage or open neutrals. Pick a model with auto shutoff first, then compare warranty and build."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the Power Watchdog PWD30 worth it over a $50 GEARGO?",
    "a": "Only if you want phone monitoring from a trusted brand. The PWD30 warns but does not disconnect, while the GEARGO actually cuts power. For pure protection per dollar, the GEARGO wins."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set up a surge protector at the pedestal?",
    "a": "Turn the pedestal breaker off, plug in the protector, turn the breaker on, and read the indicators. If the readout is good, turn the breaker off again, plug in your RV cord, and turn it back on. Never plug or unplug under load."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I know if my surge protector needs replacing?",
    "a": "Replace it after a known lightning event or major surge, if a surge failure light comes on, or if the housing is cracked or the plug shows heat marks. Budget units without a failure indicator should be replaced every few seasons of heavy use."
