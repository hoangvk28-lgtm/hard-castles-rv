  "Before you compare models, three decisions narrow an RV surge protector purchase more than any spec sheet. Is the rig 30 amp or 50 amp, since the plug decides which units fit. Should the protector be a plug-in that travels with the cord or a hardwired box bolted inside the rig. And do you want a protector that merely absorbs spikes or one that also disconnects at bad voltage. Each answer rules out most of the market.",
  "We compared six protectors from $17.59 to $399.99 that span those decisions: a hardwired 30 amp Power Watchdog, a WiFi 50 amp Power Watchdog, two GEARGO relay-and-app plug-ins, a plain 50 amp unit and a budget 30 amp unit. This is the hub guide, so each pick represents a type of buyer, and the sibling guides for 30 amp, 50 amp, EMS and travel trailers go deeper into each branch."

    "criterion": "Plug-in versus hardwired",
    "explanation": "A plug-in protector moves with you and costs less but can be stolen or forgotten. A hardwired unit protects every site and cannot be removed at the pedestal, but needs installation and costs more. Choose based on how often the rig moves, not on a joule figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Disconnect behavior",
    "explanation": "Some protectors only absorb spikes, while others open a relay when voltage falls below about 103 or 104 volts. Low voltage is a common cause of air conditioner damage. Read the listing for a stated window and for whether reconnect is automatic or needs a manual reset."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Replaceable surge module",
    "explanation": "Surge components wear as they absorb energy, so a protector can stop protecting while still showing a green light. A replaceable module, such as the one on the Power Watchdog units, lets you swap the worn part instead of the whole box. Check the listing for the words replaceable surge module."

    "q": "What is the most common mistake when buying an RV surge protector?",

    "q": "Will a surge protector work with a generator?",
    "a": "Many do, but generator output can be unstable and a unit with a cutoff window may trip repeatedly. If you run a generator regularly, check the listing for generator use or consider a unit built for it."
  },
  {
    "q": "How often should I replace a surge protector?",
    "a": "There is no fixed schedule. Replace a plug-in unit after a nearby lightning strike or if the display shows an error, and swap the surge module on a Power Watchdog after a major spike."
