  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flow-through versus cap",
    "explanation": "Flow-through sensors allow adding air without removing them, but they are heavier and should be used with metal valve stems. Cap sensors are lighter and screw on. The GUTA GT80 Flow-Thru lists flow-through, and most other listings do not state it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Signal distance",
    "explanation": "A sensor must reach the display from the trailer, and listings range from 26 ft to over 100 ft with a repeater. A long rig needs more range. Look for a stated distance and a repeater option."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Waterproofing and build",
    "explanation": "Sensors sit by the wheel in rain, road spray and heat. The Tymate TM12 4-Set lists IP67 waterproofing, which resists dust and water immersion. Look for an IP rating on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery and alerts",
    "explanation": "Sensors run on small batteries, and the display warns when they run low. Replaceable batteries are cheaper long term than sealed sensors. Look for a low battery alert, as the GUTA GT90 lists."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sensor count",
