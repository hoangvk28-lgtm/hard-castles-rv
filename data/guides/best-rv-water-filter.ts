It gives up the replaceable cartridges of the OKBA and Filterelated canister kits, so you throw the whole unit away at the end of its life.\n\nBest for campers who want one proven, low-fuss filter on the drinking hose.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Hose filter or canister kit",
    "explanation": "A hose-end filter is a sealed cartridge that screws between the spigot and your hose, while a canister kit uses refillable housings on a bracket. The difference matters because a hose filter is cheap and quick but fully disposable, while a canister kit lets you swap only the cartridge. Check whether the listing says the cartridges are replaceable and what size they take."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Certification named on the listing",
    "explanation": "NSF/ANSI 42 covers chlorine, taste and odor, while NSF/ANSI 53 covers health-related claims. A line that says NSF-certified materials is not the same as performance testing. Look for the exact standard number in the listing bullets, not only the word certified."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Micron rating of each stage",
    "explanation": "The micron figure is the smallest particle a stage is meant to block, so lower is finer. A 20 micron stage is a sediment screen, while a 0.5 micron carbon block is much tighter. Read the rating for every stage, since a dual kit can pair a coarse and a fine one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stated capacity and season life",
    "explanation": "Gallon ratings and three-month life claims tell you how often you buy again. Carbon wears out quietly, so a cartridge that still flows is not necessarily still working. Find the gallon or month figure on the listing and set a calendar reminder."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Flow rate and pressure drop",
    "explanation": "Every filter slows your flow a little, and small cartridges slow it more. A listing that states gpm helps you judge whether showers and fills will stay brisk. If none is given, expect a modest flow and avoid chaining many stages."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fittings and hose strain",
    "explanation": "A filter hanging from a low spigot pulls on the threads. Brass fittings and flexible hose protectors reduce leaks and kinks. Confirm 3/4 inch garden hose threads and look for a protector or bracket."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a pressure regulator with an RV water filter?",
    "a": "Yes, use one. Connect the spigot, regulator, filter, then hose, so campground pressure is limited before it reaches the filter housing and your plumbing."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the biggest mistake with RV water filters?",
    "a": "Treating any carbon filter as a purifier. The media named here targets chlorine, taste and sediment, and none of these listings claims bacteria removal, so use another step for questionable water."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a dual canister kit worth it over a hose filter?",
    "a": "If you camp on one site for weeks or meet dirty water, yes, because a separate sediment stage protects the carbon. For short trips on clean hookups the Camco 2-Pack is simpler."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a hose-end filter?",
    "a": "Turn off the spigot, thread the filter on by hand with the arrow or inlet side toward the water source, then open the spigot slowly. Flush a few gallons first since new carbon sheds dust."
  },
  {
    "q": "When should I replace the filter?",
    "a": "Follow the listed gallon or month rating, usually about three months for these hose filters. Carbon wears out silently, so replace on schedule even if flow still seems fine."
