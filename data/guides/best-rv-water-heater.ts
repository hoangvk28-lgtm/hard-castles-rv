  "RV water heaters come in two real types: a 6-gallon tank unit like the Suburban that stores hot water, and a propane tankless unit that heats on demand. The choice turns on how much hot water you use in a row, how big your existing cutout is, and whether you can supply the 12V control power a tankless unit needs.",
  "This hub sorts six picks into those camps and explains what each trades away. Headline GPM figures mean little without the inlet and outlet temperatures, and propane tankless units typically still need 12V power, so read both before buying."

    "explanation": "BTU is heating power, while GPM is flow at a specific temperature rise, such as 40 or 60 degrees. A GPM number without the rise is incomplete. Look for both and compare them within the same type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tank versus tankless",
    "explanation": "A 6-gallon tank runs out after a limited amount of hot water and then needs time to recover, while a tankless heats continuously. Tankless units need adequate gas supply and flow. Match to your household."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "12V power requirement",
    "explanation": "Many propane tankless units still need 12V DC to run the fan and control board. Your battery must support it. Check the listing for voltage and draw."

  {
    "criterion": "Cutout and venting",
    "explanation": "Your existing opening decides what fits, and doors and vents vary. A wrong fit means carpentry. Measure the opening and compare it to the 13 by 13 inch size named on some listings."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Altitude and freeze protection",
    "explanation": "Burners need adjustment above certain altitudes, and tanks can freeze in winter. That matters if you camp in the mountains or in winter. Look for an altitude rating, such as 9,800 feet, and freeze notes."
