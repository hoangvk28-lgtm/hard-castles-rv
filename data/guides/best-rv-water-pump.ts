export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Flow in GPM",
    "explanation": "Flow decides how fast a shower or sink fills, and it falls as pressure rises. A pump rated 5.5 GPM at open flow may deliver less in your plumbing. Compare GPM at the stated pressure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pressure and cut-in",
    "explanation": "Pressure is how hard the pump pushes, and cut-in and cut-out define when it starts and stops. Higher pressure can stress fixtures. Match PSI to your plumbing and avoid raising it blindly."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Amp draw",
    "explanation": "Pumps draw several amps when running, and the draw grows with flow. A weak wire or fuse causes voltage drop. Look for the maximum amp draw and check your wire gauge."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Self-priming lift",
    "explanation": "Self-priming lift lets the pump draw water from a tank below it. A pump with a short lift can fail when the tank is low. Look for the lift in feet or meters."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Protection and noise",
    "explanation": "Dry-run and thermal protection prevent burnout, and rubber feet cut vibration. This matters when a tank runs dry. Look for those features by name."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Port size and fit",
    "explanation": "Ports vary between 1/2 inch and 3/4 inch, and replacement models match specific mounts. A mismatch needs adapters. Check the port size and the model number listed."

  {
    "q": "Can 55 PSI harm my RV plumbing?",
    "a": "It can on older fixtures built for lower pressure. Check your plumbing rating. The wassermann 3.5 GPM runs at 45 PSI."
