  {
    "criterion": "WiFi band and speed",
    "explanation": "2.4 GHz reaches farther but is slower, and 5 GHz is faster at shorter range. This changes how well video streams. Look for the bands named and the stated speeds."

  {
    "criterion": "Antenna and mounting",
    "explanation": "An outdoor omni antenna can receive farther than a built-in one, but needs a mast or pole. Mounting height matters. Look for the antenna type and what is included."
