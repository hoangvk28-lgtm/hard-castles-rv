  "Small in an RV generator should mean something you can lift into a bumper bay or a truck bed, not a unit that only produces a few hundred watts. The listings here run from 46 to 56 pounds where weight is stated, yet their rated output ranges from 2,900 to 3,600 watts, which is enough for one rooftop air conditioner in many small trailers but not for an air conditioner, microwave and water heater all together. The honest question is how much output you need, because the same body size can hold very different engines.",
  "We compared six compact generators priced from $262.18 to $554.99 on rated rather than starting watts, whether the 30A outlet is a TT-30R that fits a trailer cord directly, stated noise, tank size and weight. Two are WEN models, and the rest are AIVOLT, PowerSmart, Pulsar and Oxseryn. Weight and noise are missing from some listings, so we say so instead of guessing."

At 53 pounds it is still easy to move, and the panel has two three-prong 120V receptacles, one TT-30R RV receptacle, a 12V DC outlet, an intelligent data meter and two 5V USB ports. The listing includes fuel shutoff and a three-year warranty.\n\nIt costs $554.99, the highest in this guide. Compared with the WEN 3600 it is $56.99 more ($554.99 versus $498) for 700 extra rated watts (3,600 versus 2,900) and 7 more pounds (53 versus 46). Against the AIVOLT 4300 it is $105 more and gives 150 more rated watts than the AIVOLT's 3,450 running, but the AIVOLT is 2 pounds lighter. The PowerSmart 3800 is $55 cheaper and adds propane, though at 3,300 gas running watts.\n\nPick this if your small trailer has a 30A system and you want the full 3,600W available for an air conditioner and other appliances without stepping up to a heavy open-frame unit. The caveat is that it does not list a decibel figure or tank size in the feature bullets, so confirm those on the product page.",

Against the AIVOLT 4300 it is $48.01 more ($498 versus $449.99) for 550 fewer running watts (2,900 versus 3,450), though the AIVOLT's TT-30 comes via an included adapter rather than a native receptacle.

    "criterion": "RV plug type",
    "explanation": "A TT-30R receptacle takes a standard RV cord directly, while an L5-30R twist-lock needs an adapter. If the listing only says 30A or RV port, the plug shape is unclear. Look for the exact receptacle code in the outlet list and budget for an adapter when it is missing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Noise and the test condition",
    "explanation": "Stated decibel levels often come from no-load or 25 percent load tests, and a running air conditioner pushes the engine harder. The AIVOLT lists 60 dBA with no load, the Pulsar 59 dB and the Oxseryn under 72 dBA. Check the load and distance in the listing, since 23 feet is the common reference."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tank size and runtime",
    "explanation": "A one-gallon tank gives roughly 4 hours at half load, while a 2-gallon tank runs longer, so the smallest body means the most frequent refueling. The PowerSmart's propane option reaches up to 24 hours at 25 percent load on a 20-pound tank. Compare the load percentage, not just hours."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Fuel type and storage",
    "explanation": "Gasoline goes stale in a few months, so a unit that sits for long gaps is a headache without stabilizer. Propane keeps indefinitely, at the cost of about 200 fewer watts on the PowerSmart 3800. Check the rated watts per fuel and match the fuel to how often you camp."

    "q": "What size generator do I need for a small travel trailer?",
    "a": "Most small trailers with a single rooftop air conditioner need about 3,000 to 3,600 rated watts. Add the air conditioner's running watts, the fridge, the converter and electronics, then check the startup surge. If you only run lights and a fridge, a 2,900 or 3,400 watt unit is plenty."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can a small generator run a 13,500 BTU air conditioner?",
    "a": "Often, if the rated watts exceed the air conditioner's running watts and the surge capacity handles startup. The Pulsar lists support for units up to 13,500 BTU, and the 3,600-watt WEN 4500 has more margin. Check your own unit's nameplate."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the WEN 4500 worth $56.99 over the WEN 3600?",
    "a": "Yes if you run a full 30A load, since it adds 700 rated watts and 7 pounds. If you keep loads small and want the 46-pound unit, the WEN 3600 is enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I connect a small generator to my RV?",
    "a": "Place it outdoors on level ground, switch the trailer main breaker off, connect the shore cord to the TT-30R (or an adapter), start the engine and let it settle before switching loads on. Keep the exhaust away from windows."
  },
  {
    "q": "How long will a one-gallon generator run?",
    "a": "The Pulsar lists 4 hours at half load on a 1-gallon tank, so roughly 0.25 gallons per hour in that case. A running air conditioner may use more, so carry spare fuel in an approved can."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I store a small generator?",
    "a": "Run it dry or add fuel stabilizer before storage, change the oil on schedule, and keep propane tanks upright outdoors. Start it monthly. The WEN models' fuel shutoff lets the carburetor run dry before the engine stops."
