  {
    "criterion": "Charge stages and voltages",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid batteries need bulk, absorption and float charging, and each type has its own target voltages.

  },
  {
    "criterion": "Equalization suitability",
    "explanation": "Equalization is a deliberate overcharge used on some flooded banks to mix electrolyte and clear sulfation. It is wrong for AGM and gel unless the maker allows it, and wrong for lithium. Use it only if your battery manual calls for it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Temperature compensation",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid charge voltage should drop as the battery warms and rise as it cools. A controller with a sensor can adjust automatically, while others rely on fixed voltages. Check if the listing mentions a sensor and otherwise consider seasonal adjustment."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Chemistry lock-in",
    "explanation": "Some units, such as Depvko 30A PWM, say they are only for lead-acid batteries. If you may switch to lithium later, choose a unit that also lists lithium. Read the compatibility line carefully before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Array and amp fit",
    "explanation": "Divide array watts by 12 to find the minimum amps on a 12V bank. For example, 200W is about 17A, so a 20A or 30A unit fits and a 10A one does not. Leave some headroom for cold, bright days."
