This guide looks at six controllers whose listings name LiFePO4 and checks how they let you set that profile, from a preset LFP mode to a fully custom one.",
  "This guide ranks units that offer a dedicated LFP preset or editable voltages above those that just list LiFePO4 on the box, since a label tells you little about the actual charge behavior. This guide also notes where PWM design limits what a lithium bank can get out of your panels."

  },
  {
    "criterion": "No equalization stage",
    "explanation": "Equalization is a deliberate overcharge used on some lead-acid banks and is wrong for LiFePO4. A controller that cycles through equalization on a lithium profile can stress the battery. Confirm the LFP or user mode skips equalization before you leave it unattended."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold-charge protection",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 cells can be damaged by charging below about 32F, so winter camping needs a low-temperature cut-off in the controller or the battery's own BMS. This protection is cheap insurance for an expensive battery. Check whether the listing mentions a cut-off or temperature sensor, and if not, confirm the battery has one."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PWM versus MPPT with lithium",
    "explanation": "PWM can charge lithium but needs panel voltage above about 14V and wastes any extra, while MPPT converts that extra into current. For arrays above a few hundred watts the difference is noticeable. Compare your array size to the controller's PV limit and amp rating."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Monitoring and logging",
    "explanation": "A display or app that shows battery voltage lets you confirm the charge profile is doing what you set. A 30-day generation log or app graph helps you notice a drop in output. Look for a readable screen or app on the listing and check whether any module is sold separately."

    "q": "How should I maintain a LiFePO4 solar controller?",
