  {
    "criterion": "Low-temperature charge cut-off",
    "explanation": "Charging lithium below about 32F can plate lithium and shorten life. Some controllers cut off at low temperature while others leave it to the battery's BMS. Check the listing for a low-temperature feature or confirm your battery has one."

    "criterion": "Operating temperature range",
    "explanation": "A controller rated across a wide range, such as -40F to 149F, keeps working on hot roofs and cold mornings. Narrow ranges can shut down early. Look for the range in the spec sheet rather than a vague all-weather label."
