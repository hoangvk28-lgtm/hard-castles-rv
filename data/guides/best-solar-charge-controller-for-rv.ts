This guide frames six controllers around that sizing math, from 8A units for a single small panel to a 30A PWM that accepts about 450W on a 12V bank.",

The tradeoff is PWM regulation and a 55V PV limit.\n\nBest for a travel trailer or camper with two to four 100W panels.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Roof array wattage math",
    "explanation": "Add up the watts of every panel you plan to install, then divide by the battery voltage to find the minimum controller amps. For example, 400W on a 12V bank is about 33A, so a 30A PWM is already stretched and a 40A MPPT is more comfortable. Compare that number to the amp rating and the maximum PV watts in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "House bank voltage",
    "explanation": "Most RVs run a 12V house bank, but some larger rigs use 24V to cut current. A controller must match the bank voltage, and some units auto-detect while others are 12V only. Check your bank voltage on the battery or inverter label and compare it to the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Panel wiring and PV limit",
    "explanation": "Parallel wiring keeps voltage low and works with most small controllers, while series wiring raises voltage and needs a higher PV limit. BougeRV Li 30A lists a 55V maximum, so a series string must stay under that in cold weather. Find your panels' Voc, multiply by the number in series and add margin."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cold-weather behavior",
    "explanation": "LiFePO4 batteries should not accept charge below freezing, and flooded batteries want temperature compensation. A controller or BMS that blocks cold charging protects an expensive bank. Check whether your battery has its own low-temperature protection before relying on the controller."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mounting and wire length",
    "explanation": "Controllers work best close to the battery with short, thick cable, because long runs drop voltage. Compact units like Voltset 10A can tuck into tight bays, while 30A units need larger terminals. Measure the run before buying and choose wire gauge for the amps."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What size controller do I need for 400W of RV panels?",
    "a": "Divide 400W by 12V to get about 33A, then pick the next size up. Among these picks, BougeRV Li 30A PWM is the largest and may clip at that size, so consider a bigger MPPT unit."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I use my RV's existing controller with lithium batteries?",
    "a": "Only if it has a lithium profile or adjustable voltage. Check the manual or listing for LFP or user-defined settings before switching batteries."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is MPPT worth it on an RV roof?",
    "a": "Usually yes for arrays above roughly 300W or with higher-voltage panels. For a single small panel, PWM like Renogy Wanderer 10A is adequate."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the safest way to wire a RV solar controller?",
    "a": "Place it near the battery, in a dry and ventilated spot, and fuse the battery side. Short thick wires reduce voltage drop, and a waterproof unit like SOLPERK 10A PWM can sit in a bumper bay. On a RV solar controller, double-check polarity at every terminal before powering up and use wire sized for the rated amps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I maintain a RV solar controller?",
    "a": "On a RV solar controller, tighten terminals and inspect cable insulation at the start of each season, and keep vents, fans or heat-sink surfaces free of dust. Check terminals and wire insulation each season, especially after travel vibration. Keep the case clear of dust and moisture."
