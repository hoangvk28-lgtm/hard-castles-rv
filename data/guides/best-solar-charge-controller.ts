  "A solar charge controller sits between your panels and your battery and keeps the battery from being overcharged, so choosing one starts with knowing which type you need. This guide is a tour of the main kinds you will meet on RV listings: a high-amp MPPT unit, a waterproof PWM unit, a bundle of two, a lead-acid-only budget unit and a tiny 12V model.",

A backlit LCD reports battery voltage, PV and discharge current, temperature and error codes, and the controller can switch a load on a timer or by light level.\n\nCompared with the PWM units below it, it is the only one here whose listing talks about maximum power point tracking and a 100V panel input, which lets it work with higher-voltage panels. The tradeoff against the compact HUINE 20A is size and wiring effort, since 100A needs heavy cable.\n\nBest for a buyer who wants room to grow a roof array or move to 24V or 48V later.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "PWM or MPPT regulation",
    "explanation": "PWM controllers connect the panel to the battery and pull panel voltage down to battery voltage, while MPPT controllers convert extra panel voltage into additional charge current. The difference matters most when your panels are rated well above the battery voltage, in cold weather or with panels wired in series, where MPPT can recover roughly 20 to 30 percent more energy. Check the listing for the words maximum power point tracking and a tracking efficiency figure rather than relying on the product name alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Amp rating versus array size",
    "explanation": "The amp rating is the most current the controller can pass to the battery, and you size it by dividing array watts by battery voltage. For example, 400W on a 12V battery is about 33A, so a 40A unit fits while a 20A one would clip. Look at the controller's stated maximum PV watts per battery voltage in the listing, since some units also cap watts regardless of amps."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum PV input voltage",
    "explanation": "Panel open-circuit voltage rises in cold weather, and a controller's maximum PV input voltage is the line you must stay under or risk destroying it. A 100V ceiling can handle a short series string but not a long one. Find the Voc on the panel label, add roughly 20 to 25 percent for cold mornings, and compare it to the controller's stated limit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry support",
    "explanation": "Lead-acid and lithium batteries want different charge voltages, and a LiFePO4 bank generally wants an absorption voltage around 14.2 to 14.6V with no equalization. A controller that supports only lead-acid can undercharge or stress a lithium bank. Read the listing for named chemistries and a selectable or user-defined profile before buying."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating and placement",
    "explanation": "An IP67 or IP68 rating means the case is sealed against moisture, which matters when the controller is mounted on a panel frame or a bumper box. Most controllers still work best in a dry, ventilated spot close to the battery, because short thick wires reduce voltage drop. Confirm the IP number on the listing and check the cable length so you are not forced into a bad mounting spot."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a charge controller with a single small panel?",
    "a": "Yes, in most cases. Even a small panel can overcharge a battery over a long sunny stretch, and a controller prevents that. Very small trickle panels sometimes include one, so check the panel label before adding another."
  },
  {
    "q": "What mistake do buyers make with a solar charge controller?",
    "a": "Connecting the panel before the battery, or reversing polarity. Most controllers expect the battery to be connected first so they can detect system voltage, and a wrong order can confuse auto-detection or blow a fuse."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is MPPT worth the extra money over PWM?",
    "a": "It is worth it when your panels have a higher voltage than the battery, when you run panels in series or in cold climates. For one or two 12V-class panels, PWM like HUINE 20A is often enough and cheaper."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the safest way to wire a solar charge controller?",
    "a": "Divide your total panel watts by the battery voltage to get the minimum amps, then pick a controller rated above that. For example, 300W on a 12V battery is about 25A, so a 30A unit gives a comfortable margin. On a solar charge controller, double-check polarity at every terminal before powering up and use wire sized for the rated amps."
  },
  {
    "q": "How should I maintain a solar charge controller?",
    "a": "On a solar charge controller, tighten terminals and inspect cable insulation at the start of each season, and keep vents, fans or heat-sink surfaces free of dust. Check the terminals for tightness and corrosion once or twice a year, and keep the vents clear of dust. If it is mounted outside, confirm the seals and cable entries are intact after each season."
