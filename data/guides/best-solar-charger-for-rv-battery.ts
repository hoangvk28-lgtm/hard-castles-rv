  "A small solar charger will not run your RV, but it can keep a starter or house battery alive through months of storage. The question is how many watt-hours reach the battery on a normal day and whether the controller regulates charging properly. We compared three 12V chargers at 30W and 50W, translated nameplate watts into daily energy at 3, 5 and 7 sun hours, and picked by use case."

At $89.99 it pairs a 50W panel with real MPPT regulation.\n\nIt is $19.00 below the SOLPERK 50W and $10.04 above the SUNER POWER 30W, so you get the same wattage as SOLPERK for less, plus MPPT. A 50W panel adds about 250Wh at 5 sun hours before losses. Pick this for a stored RV battery; the caveat is that it is a maintainer, not a daily-use charger.",

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watts to daily watt-hours",
    "explanation": "A 50W panel gives about 250Wh at 5 sun hours before losses, and a 30W gives about 150Wh. A typical RV battery self-drains a few watt-hours per day, so these are for maintenance. Multiply watts by your sun hours and subtract about 20% to estimate real output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "MPPT or basic control",
    "explanation": "MPPT controllers adjust voltage to extract more power in weak light, which helps in winter. Basic controllers waste some output. Look for the word MPPT in the title or bullets, as on POWOXI 50W and SUNER POWER 30W."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Charging stages",
    "explanation": "A three-stage charger runs bulk, absorption and float, so it can sit connected without boiling the battery. Without float, a charger may overcharge over months. SUNER POWER 30W states three stages."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weather rating",
    "explanation": "A charger on a dashboard or roof sees rain, so IP65 or IP67 controllers matter. Corrosion at the connectors is a common failure. Check the IP number for both the panel connection and the controller."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry compatibility",
    "explanation": "Some maintainers target lead acid and may not suit lithium without a lithium mode. Charging profile and voltage matter for LiFePO4. None of these listings details lithium support, so confirm with the seller before connecting a lithium battery."

export const faq = [

  {
    "q": "Does it need a separate controller?",
    "a": "No, each includes its own, but you should connect it directly to the battery, not through other loads."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I leave it connected all year?",
    "a": "Yes, since SUNER POWER 30W and others stop at full charge, but check the battery water level if it is lead acid."

  {
    "q": "Is POWOXI 50W better than SOLPERK 50W?",
    "a": "For output, POWOXI 50W names MPPT for $19.00 less. SOLPERK 50W emphasizes glass and frame durability."
