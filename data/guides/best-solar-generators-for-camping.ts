The value angle is not about being perfect. It is about keeping the must-have features in the cart. For buyers searching specifically for solar generators for camping, the main value is narrowing the product to the exact connection, load, and safety constraint behind that query. As a backup-power accessory, it should be compared against products solving the same job, not against every power product with a similar title.\n\nThe useful question is not whether the accessory looks compatible. It is whether 519Wh capacity, 500W continuous output, and 100W solar panel match the actual backup-power routine. Generator accessories often fail at the edges: too short a cord, wrong inlet shape, poor cover fit, or missing service part compatibility. This pick is worth considering when those details line up cleanly.\n\nThe product has value only if it improves the real routine. For camping, that means faster setup, safer spacing, clearer maintenance, or better storage. Skip it if it adds another part to remember without solving a specific weak point. Choose it when it makes the backup-power system easier to use correctly.",

  { criterion: "Usable watt-hours must match the trip", explanation: "A 1,070Wh station like the Jackery 1000 v2 class can support a very different weekend than a 256Wh ALLWEI PPS300-4. Start with the watts and hours for each device, then subtract reserve for inverter loss, idle drain, cold weather, and cloudy-day uncertainty. Do not size from the product category name alone." },
  { criterion: "Panel wattage decides whether solar keeps up", explanation: "The Jackery 300 kit includes a 40W panel, while the 1000 v2 kit includes a 200W panel. That difference matters more than many roundups admit because camping is a daily refill problem, not just a stored-energy problem. Match panel size to the energy you need to replace each day." },
  { criterion: "AC output is not the same as runtime", explanation: "The Jackery 1000 v2 can output 1,500W, but high-watt appliances can drain a 1,070Wh battery quickly. The GRECELL EB500 has a lower 500W AC limit but may be plenty for electronics and small campsite loads. Use high AC output for short bursts, not as proof of long runtime." },
  { criterion: "Weight and cable bulk affect real camping use", explanation: "A 23.8-pound station is fine for car camping but much less pleasant for long carries. Small kits like the Jackery 300 or ALLWEI PPS300-4 are easier to move, but their smaller batteries limit comfort loads. Choose the kit around the campsite distance from the vehicle." },
  { criterion: "Port selection can save battery", explanation: "USB-C PD, DC outputs, and car ports can reduce conversion waste compared with using AC for everything. The GRECELL EB500 and Jackery units both offer multiple output types, which helps when charging phones, laptops, cameras, and 12V devices. Use the most efficient compatible port for each device." }

export const faq = [
  { q: "What size solar generator do I need for camping?", a: "Light electronics can work with 250Wh to 500Wh. A fridge, CPAP, laptop work, or multiple nights usually pushes the recommendation toward 1,000Wh or more. Add solar only after you know how much energy you need to replace each day." },
  { q: "Is a 200W solar panel enough for camping?", a: "A 200W panel can be enough for many weekend setups, but only with good sun and moderate loads. It is much stronger than a 40W panel for refilling a 1kWh station. Fridge use, shade, and cloudy weather can still require extra capacity." },
  { q: "Can a solar generator run a camping fridge?", a: "Yes, if the inverter can handle startup and the battery has enough watt-hours for the fridge duty cycle. Hot weather makes fridges run more often. Test the fridge and station before depending on it for food storage." },
  { q: "Should I buy a bundle or station only?", a: "A bundle is simpler because the panel is matched to the station. A station-only purchase can be smarter if you already own compatible panels or want a larger solar array. Check voltage, connector, and input limits before mixing brands." },
  { q: "Can I use a solar generator inside a tent?", a: "Battery stations do not create exhaust during use, but they still need protection from water, heat, and physical damage. Follow the manual for charging, ventilation, and temperature limits. Keep cables routed where they will not be tripped over or pinched." },
  { q: "Why not buy the biggest battery?", a: "Bigger batteries cost more, weigh more, and take longer to recharge from small panels. If your camping load is mostly phones and lights, a smaller station can be more pleasant to use. Buy enough capacity for the job, not the largest number available." }
