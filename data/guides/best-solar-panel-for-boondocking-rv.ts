  "Boondocking changes the math: you cannot plug in when the battery runs low, so solar has to cover a full 24-hour load. A 60Ah daily draw at 12V is about 720Wh, and a single 200W panel yields roughly 600 to 1,400Wh depending on sun hours. We compared four setups from a $94.77 foldable panel to a $2,199.99 kit with a 3840Wh battery."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "24-hour load profile",
    "explanation": "Start with what you use in a day: a 12V fridge about 400Wh, lights and phones 100Wh, a laptop 200Wh. A 200W panel at 5 sun hours gives about 1,000Wh, so that 700Wh load fits. Add up your devices before choosing panel watts."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sun hours by season",
    "explanation": "Winter may give only 3 sun hours, cutting 200W to about 600Wh, while desert summer gives 7 or more. Plan on the worst season you will camp in. Check your region's sun-hour chart and size for that number."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "PWM versus MPPT",
    "explanation": "MPPT controllers extract more power in cold or low light, while PWM controllers simply connect. Renogy 200W Kit uses PWM, so expect somewhat lower yields. Look for the controller type on the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery storage versus refill",
    "explanation": "A 3,840Wh battery is not helpful if the panels add only 1,000Wh per day. Size storage for two cloudy days and panels to refill it. Compare battery watt-hours to panel daily output."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Shading and roof space",
    "explanation": "Shade from a vent can drop a standard panel output sharply, while N-type anti-shading designs hold up better. Two 100W panels take about 2 square meters. Measure free roof area before buying."
