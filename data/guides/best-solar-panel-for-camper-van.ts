  "A camper van gives you maybe 12 to 20 square feet of usable roof once the fan, vent and rails take their share, so nameplate watts mean little until you check footprint. Panel size, weight and wiring decide whether a pick actually fits your van. Here you get four options from a 400W kit down to a 0.1 inch flexible panel, plus daily watt-hour math at 3, 5 and 7 sun hours, the limits of the included controllers, and which pick suits a vented roof, a curved roof or a full-time rig."

Renogy rates it at about 1000Wh a day on 5 hours of direct sun, and the cells are listed at 22% efficiency. Z-brackets and cables come in the box.\n\nAgainst the Renogy 400W Kit it costs $294.08 less and fits a typical van roof without crowding the vent. It also gives you real mounting hardware, which the flexible panels do not. Pick this if you want a complete plug in system for a van with a 100Ah to 200Ah bank.

Four times 100W worth of glass gives the most daily energy, roughly double what the 200W class makes.\n\nCompared with the Renogy 200W Kit you pay $294.08 more for twice the nameplate watts.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Rated watts versus real watt-hours",
    "explanation": "Nameplate watts are a lab figure under ideal light, not what lands in your battery. Multiply watts by sun hours, then by roughly 0.75 for losses, so 200W at 5 sun hours gives about 750Wh. Check the listing for a stated daily output like 1000Wh and compare it to your fridge and device draw."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Roof footprint and obstructions",
    "explanation": "A vent, fan and rails can leave only a few square feet of flat roof. A panel that does not fit forces you to cut watts or move gear. Measure the free area and compare it to the listed dimensions, such as the Topunive's 36.22 by 23.22 inches."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rigid versus flexible build",
    "explanation": "Rigid panels stay cooler and last longer, while flexible ETFE panels weigh less and follow curves. Heat reduces output, and glued flexible panels cannot shed it as well. Look for the stated bend radius or a 240 degree flex rating before buying for a curved roof."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller type and limits",
    "explanation": "PWM controllers like the Wanderer 30A cost less but waste voltage, while MPPT recovers more energy in cold or cloudy weather. A 30A limit caps what you can add later. Check the listing for the controller type, amp rating and lithium support."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Battery chemistry support",
    "explanation": "Lithium needs a controller with a lithium charge profile, or the bank can be under or overcharged. Many kits only list lead acid. Confirm that lithium, AGM and gel are all named on the listing before assuming the controller fits your bank."

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How many watts of solar does a camper van need?",
    "a": "Most vans do well with 200W to 400W on a compressor fridge, fans and a laptop. Add up your daily watt-hours and divide by 3 to 5 sun hours."
  },
  {
    "q": "Can I mount flexible panels without drilling?",
    "a": "Yes, flexible panels are usually glued to the roof with adhesive made for the job. Wiring still needs one roof entry for the cable."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do I need MPPT or is PWM enough?",
    "a": "PWM is fine for small 12V setups with matching panels. MPPT earns its price on larger arrays or in winter when voltage drops."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a 100W panel run a van fridge?",
    "a": "A 100W panel makes about 300 to 500Wh a day, which can cover a small efficient fridge. A heavy user will want 200W or more."
  },
  {
    "q": "Does cloud cover ruin solar output?",
