  "A travel trailer has far more roof than a van, so the real limits are your controller, your battery bank and how much wiring you are willing to run. Four options are compared here, from a 100W starter kit up to 400W of N-Type panels. Each is translated into daily watt-hours at 3, 5 and 7 sun hours, with a note on expansion headroom, included hardware and what you still have to buy before the first charge."

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Watts versus daily energy",
    "explanation": "Rated watts only show peak output in perfect light. A 200W array at 4 sun hours makes about 800Wh, as the ECO-WORTHY listing states. Divide your daily watt-hour use by your sun hours to find the array size you need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller amp rating",
    "explanation": "A 30A controller handles about 400W at 12V, then stops. Going past that means replacing the controller. Check the listing for the amp number and voltage limits before adding panels."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Cell technology and efficiency",
    "explanation": "N-Type 16BB cells like the HQST's reach 25.4% efficiency and handle low light better than older types. The difference shows on cloudy mornings. Check the cell type and efficiency in the listing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Rigid versus flexible",
    "explanation": "Rigid panels cost less and cool better, while flexible ones weigh less and fit curves. Heat lowers output, and glued panels shed heat poorly. Choose flexible only if your roof demands it."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Warranty length and coverage",
    "explanation": "A solar panel should last decades, so warranty length is a clue. Renogy states 10 years on the panel and 2 on the controller, while ECO-WORTHY lists 1 year. Look for separate panel and controller terms."
