The system can watch your towing truck and up to four towable vehicles, and the sensors use user-replaceable CR2032 batteries.\n\nAgainst the GUTA GT20 below it, the TST starts with only four sensors, so a motorhome needs expansion sensors to cover six tires. In exchange it offers a three-year warranty on the system and USA-based live customer support, which the GUTA listing does not mention.\n\nIt fits a Class A owner who plans to build up a full system over time, adding sensors for dual rear tires and a toad.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Dual rear tire access",
    "explanation": "A Class A usually runs dual rear wheels, and the inner tire's valve stem can be awkward to reach. Flow-through sensors let you add air without removing the sensor, which saves time at every fill. Check the listing for the words flow-through or extension, and favor metal valve stems if you choose that design."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Motorhome pressure range",
    "explanation": "Class A tires can need 80 to 125 psi cold, and a sensor needs headroom above that to read correctly. A kit that stops at 87 psi will not suit most coaches. Read the stated maximum on the title or specification list and keep it comfortably above your tire's max cold pressure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Toad and tow-vehicle support",
    "explanation": "A Class A that tows a car doubles the tire count and adds another set of sensors to pair. Some systems track a towed vehicle or several, while others hold only a single profile. Look for a statement of tow-vehicle support or a high maximum tire count on the display."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Signal length across a coach",
    "explanation": "A 40 foot coach puts the rear tires far from a dash display, and steel framing weakens radio signals. Quoted ranges run from about 36 to 120 feet with boosters. Measure from your dash to the rear dual and add margin before you accept a quoted range."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Sensor battery type",
    "explanation": "A replaceable coin cell battery costs a few dollars and takes a minute to swap, while a sealed sensor forces you to replace the entire unit. The TST 507 Cap lists CR2032 batteries as user-replaceable, and other listings do not say. Check the product page before you buy, since a motorhome has six or more sensors to maintain."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Support when a sensor fails",
    "explanation": "A failed sensor on a motorhome can leave a key tire unmonitored for a whole season. Warranty length and support availability vary widely, and some listings give no terms. Look for a stated warranty period and a US-based support option before committing."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "How many sensors does a Class A motorhome need?",
    "a": "A typical Class A has six tires, so a six-sensor kit covers the coach. A toad adds four more, which is why the GUTA GT20's ten sensors fit that setup well."
  },
  {
    "q": "Will a TPMS read the inner dual tire?",
    "a": "It can, because the sensor sits on that tire's valve stem. The practical issue is adding air, which is why the Tymate TM12 Flow suits duals better than standard screw-on types."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the TST 507 Cap worth the premium over the Tymate TM2?",
    "a": "If you want a multi-year warranty, replaceable batteries and tow-vehicle support, yes. The Tymate TM2 is cheaper but stops at 87 PSI, which is below many motorhome tire pressures."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I install a TPMS on a Class A?",
    "a": "Remove the valve caps, thread the labeled sensors onto each stem, and power the monitor. Check each reading before driving, and verify the signal from the back of the coach. Add a booster or repeater if any tire drops out."
  },
  {
    "q": "What should I do if one sensor loses signal?",
    "a": "Check the battery first, then the position and any metal obstruction between the sensor and the display. A booster often fixes it on a long coach. If the sensor is sealed and still dead, replace the unit."
