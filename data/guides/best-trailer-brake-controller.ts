  "A trailer brake controller is the dash-side box that tells your trailer's electric brakes how hard to grab when you press the pedal. This list starts with four actual controllers and ends with two wiring harnesses, because the harness is the part many first-time buyers forget and the part that decides whether the install takes ten minutes or an afternoon.",
  "Picks are ordered by how complete the answer is for a typical electric-brake travel trailer. Controllers rank above accessories, controllers that state their braking type and axle range rank above vague ones, and anything sold as a copy of a Tekonsha model is labeled as a third-party clone so nobody mistakes it for the original."

The listing names 1-4 axle trailers and 9 levels of boost, and says the display and controller each carry two 32-bit chips.\n\nCompared with the CURT Discovery below it, the Kohree senses tow-vehicle deceleration instead of ramping on a timer, so braking follows how hard you actually stop. The trade is a higher price and a two-piece install, since you have to route the display cable and mount both parts.\n\nBest for a buyer who tows a mid-size or larger travel trailer and wants a readable display without a bulky dash box.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Controller versus harness",
    "explanation": "A controller is the box with the display and gain setting, while a harness is only the wiring that connects it to your vehicle. Buying a harness thinking it includes a controller is a common mix-up, and it leaves you with no braking at all. Read the title for words like controller, kit, or wiring harness before adding to cart."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Proportional or time-delay",
    "explanation": "A proportional unit senses how hard the tow vehicle slows and applies trailer brakes to match, while a time-delay unit ramps to a preset level over a set time. Proportional feels smoother with heavy or frequently towed trailers, and time-delay is simpler and cheaper for light loads. The listing must say which one it is; if it does not, do not assume."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Axle count rating",
    "explanation": "Each axle on an electric-brake trailer usually has two brakes, so a tandem trailer runs four brakes and a triple runs six. A controller rated for fewer axles than your trailer can overheat or underperform. Find the axle or brake range in the title or first bullet and compare it with your trailer."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Mounting and leveling",
    "explanation": "Some proportional units must sit level within a set angle, while others state that no leveling is required. This matters because a tilted unit can brake too hard or too late until you adjust it. Look for the words no leveling or self-leveling, and check the included bracket type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Vehicle harness needs",
    "explanation": "Many trucks have a factory brake controller connector under the dash that accepts a plug-in harness, and others need wires spliced in. A missing harness can add cost and time on install day. Check whether the listing includes one, and match any separate harness to your vehicle's exact model year."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Clone versus original",
    "explanation": "Several listings are written as replacements for Tekonsha or Brake-EVN part numbers, which means a different company built them. That can still be good value, but warranty and support come from the seller, not the original brand. The product title says replacement, replaces, or compatible with when this applies."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "Do I need a trailer brake controller for my RV?",
    "a": "If your trailer has electric brakes, yes, because the tow vehicle has no other way to command them. Many states require trailer brakes above a weight threshold around 3,000 lb, but rules vary, so check your state's requirements."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is the most common buying mistake?",
    "a": "Ordering a wiring harness thinking it includes the controller, or the other way around. REESE Harness and Oyviny Ram Harness in this list are accessories only, so confirm the product title says controller."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is proportional worth paying more than time-delay?",
    "a": "For heavier trailers and frequent towing, usually yes, because braking tracks how hard you stop. For light, occasional towing a time-delay unit like CURT Discovery can be enough."
  },
  {
    "q": "How do I set the gain?",
    "a": "Hitch up on a dry, level road and drive slowly while applying the manual control. Raise gain until the trailer brakes firmly without the wheels locking, then adjust boost if the trailer feels late."
  },
  {
    "q": "What if my truck already has a brake controller?",
    "a": "Some newer pickups offer a factory integrated controller, so an aftermarket unit may not be needed. Check your owner's manual or a dash menu before buying."
