export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "A High-Gain Outdoor Antenna Solves a Genuinely Different Problem Than a Standard Phone Hotspot Ever Could",
    "explanation": "A phone hotspot relies entirely on your phone's internal antenna, which is small and not optimized for capturing weak, distant cellular signals, while a dedicated RV router with an external high-gain antenna, like the KUMA pick's outdoor 2x2 MIMO design, can capture usable signal in genuinely remote areas where a phone would show no service at all. This matters significantly for camping in national parks, remote BLM land, or other areas with weak cellular infrastructure, and matters less if you primarily stay at developed campgrounds with reliable WiFi or strong cellular coverage. Consider a router with a dedicated external antenna specifically if remote or off-grid camping is part of your regular travel pattern."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bundled eSIM Data Plans Trade Carrier Choice for Convenience, While Bring-Your-Own-SIM Trades Convenience for Control",
    "explanation": "A router using built-in eSIM technology with the manufacturer's own data plans, like both TravlFi picks in this comparison, removes the need to research and purchase a separate SIM card and plan, but locks you into that manufacturer's specific network access and pricing structure, while an unlocked router accepting any compatible carrier's SIM lets you choose the specific carrier with the strongest coverage in your typical travel areas. This matters if you have strong opinions about which carrier performs best where you travel, favoring the unlocked option, and matters less if you'd rather not research carrier coverage maps yourself. Weigh your own carrier coverage research against the convenience of a bundled plan before choosing between these two approaches."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Permanent Rooftop Installation Provides Better Weatherproofing but Sacrifices Portability Between Vehicles",
    "explanation": "A sealed rooftop system like the Winegard pick is built to withstand ongoing weather exposure as a permanent fixture, generally offering more durable long-term weatherproofing than a portable unit moved in and out of storage, but this permanence means the router stays with that specific vehicle rather than transferring between an RV and a boat or a different camper. This matters if you have one dedicated RV you plan to keep long-term, favoring a permanent rooftop install, and matters less if you switch between multiple vehicles or rent different RVs across trips, favoring a portable unit instead. Consider your specific vehicle ownership situation before choosing between a permanent rooftop system and a portable indoor/outdoor kit."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "5G Availability Varies Significantly by Region, So a 5G-Capable Router Isn't Automatically Faster Everywhere You Travel",
    "explanation": "5G network coverage remains considerably less widespread than 4G LTE coverage, particularly in rural and remote camping areas where RV travelers often find themselves, meaning a 5G-capable router may frequently fall back to 4G speeds in exactly the locations where a stronger connection matters most. This matters less if your typical travel pattern stays near populated areas with established 5G infrastructure, and matters more if you frequently camp in remote or rural locations where 5G coverage is inconsistent. Check actual 5G coverage maps for your typical travel routes before paying a premium for 5G capability you may not consistently use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Multiple Built-In LAN Ports Provide More Reliable Wired Connections Than Relying on Wi-Fi Alone for Every Device",
    "explanation": "A router with several built-in LAN ports, like the KUMA pick's 4 ports, lets you hardwire devices like a smart TV, gaming console, or work computer for a faster and more stable connection than Wi-Fi alone provides, particularly valuable in an RV where Wi-Fi signal can be affected by the vehicle's metal construction and close quarters. This matters more if you have specific devices that benefit from a stable wired connection, like a work setup or a streaming device, and matters less if all your devices connect wirelessly without issue. Check a router's stated LAN port count if wired connectivity for specific devices is part of your RV setup plans."

export const faq = [
  { "q": "Do I need a special router for RV internet, or can I use a regular travel router?", "a": "A regular travel router works fine if you have reliable campground WiFi or a phone with strong cellular signal to tether from, but a dedicated RV router with an external antenna performs significantly better in remote areas with weak cellular coverage." },
  { "q": "What's the difference between eSIM-based and SIM-card-based RV routers?", "a": "eSIM-based routers use built-in digital SIM technology with the manufacturer's own bundled data plans, while SIM-card-based routers are unlocked and accept a physical SIM card from any compatible carrier you choose separately." },
  { "q": "Is a rooftop-mounted RV router better than a portable one?", "a": "A rooftop system offers better weatherproofing and often stronger reception for permanent installation on one dedicated vehicle, while a portable unit offers flexibility to move between vehicles or storage when not traveling." },
  { "q": "Do I need 5G for RV camping, or is 4G LTE sufficient?", "a": "4G LTE is sufficient for most camping needs and has more widespread coverage in rural and remote areas, while 5G offers faster speeds but remains less consistently available outside populated areas." },
  { "q": "Can an RV router work without a data plan?", "a": "No, every router in this comparison requires either a bundled eSIM data plan or a separately purchased SIM card and data plan from a cellular carrier to actually access the internet." },
  { "q": "How far can an RV router's outdoor antenna reach in a remote area?", "a": "This varies by specific antenna design and local cell tower distance, but a high-gain outdoor antenna like the KUMA pick's design is specifically built to capture signal that a standard phone or basic hotspot device would miss entirely." }
