  "For a lot of RV owners, the best value is not the cheapest battery but the one that replaces an entire lead-acid bank in a single box. A 280Ah to 460Ah LiFePO4 battery can retire two or four golf cart batteries, eliminate the parallel cabling between them, and still cost less per Ah than buying several 100Ah units.",
  "This guide focuses on that whole-bank tier. We compared Bluetooth monitoring, BMS current, case construction, cold-weather behavior, and cost per Ah across six large batteries, using specs and buyer feedback rather than marketing claims, to find which ones give boondockers the most capability for their money."

Against the VATRER and ECO-WORTHY picks below, it lacks a starting mode and a metal case, but it costs $130 to $360 less.\n\nBest for dry campers who want a single big, monitored battery without paying premium prices.

export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Cost per Ah Against Several Small Batteries",
    "explanation": "A big single battery should cost the same or less per Ah than buying several 100Ah batteries, or the convenience is costing you. Divide the price by capacity and compare it to a quality 100Ah drop-in. In this tier, figures between about $1.25 and $1.90 per Ah represent good value."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "BMS Current for Your Inverter",
    "explanation": "Large batteries are usually paired with large inverters, and at 12V a 2000W load pulls well over 170A. A 200A BMS fits a 2000W inverter, while a 250A BMS gives room for larger units. Find the continuous BMS rating in the listing and match it to your inverter, not to the surge figure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Maximum Charge Current",
    "explanation": "A 300Ah battery fed by a typical 30A to 55A converter takes many hours to refill. Batteries that accept 100A or more let a large solar array or inverter charger refill them quickly. Look for a stated charge current range and compare it with your charging sources."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Weight and Installation",
    "explanation": "Large LiFePO4 batteries weigh roughly 55 to 90 lbs, which is still lighter than the lead-acid bank they replace but too heavy for one person to lift into a compartment safely. Mounting feet and handles make a big difference. Check the listed weight and plan a two-person install."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Case Construction",
    "explanation": "Metal cases resist heat, impact, and vibration and often bolt directly to the floor, while plastic cases rely on a battery box and straps. For rigs that see washboard roads, vibration resistance can matter as much as capacity. Look for mounting feet, a metal enclosure, or internal cell brackets in the description."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Recovery and Activation Behavior",
    "explanation": "When a BMS trips on overload or deep discharge, some batteries recover automatically after a short delay, while others need a charger with 0V activation to wake up. Knowing this ahead of time avoids a stranded weekend. Check the listing for auto-recovery timing and activation notes."

    "q": "Is one 300Ah battery better than three 100Ah batteries?",
    "a": "It is simpler, with one BMS and fewer cables, and often cheaper per Ah. Three smaller batteries are easier to lift and give you redundancy if one fails, so the right choice depends on your space and how you install."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is the ECO-WORTHY 400Ah worth it over the TechCella 320Ah?",

  {
    "q": "Can my RV converter charge a 300Ah lithium battery?",
    "a": "Yes if it has a lithium profile, but a 30A to 55A converter will take many hours to fill a large battery. Many owners add solar or an inverter charger to shorten recharge time."
  },
  {
    "q": "What is a common mistake when installing a big lithium battery?",
