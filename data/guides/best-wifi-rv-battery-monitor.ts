  "A WiFi battery monitor is a shunt meter that talks to your phone over your rig's router, so it only helps when the trailer actually has a 2.4GHz network. The bigger question is the shunt: if the current rating is below your inverter draw, the meter reads wrong or fails. Five budget units are compared here by current range, voltage range, battery chemistry support, alerts, and what calibration and drift information the listing leaves out."

    "description": "The Marhynchus monitor is a coulomb meter for 10 to 100V systems with a 400A shunt rating, which covers most RV inverters. It measures voltage, current, power, charge and discharge capacity, watt-hours and time. A buzzer and pop up notices alert you to preset low capacity or low voltage, and it works with LiFePO4, lithium ion, NiMH and other chemistries.\n\nAt $106.93 it is $28.94 above the Ymiko KM105F. The extra money buys a much higher current rating, which matters if an inverter pulls 100A or more. Pick this if you run a large inverter on a lithium bank.

  {
    "criterion": "2.4GHz WiFi requirement",
